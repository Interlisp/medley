<LispCore>Good>  : used only for LISP.SYSOUT for MAKEINIT bootstrap
<LispCore>TR> 	: used for saving the technical reports for Interlisp-D

These are part of the 'release', i.e., should contain only part of what we release, and be snapshot when we relese:


LISPCORE>NEXT  =>  Lisp>Harmony>Basics (more or less)
LISPCORE>CM    =>  Lisp>Harmony>CM, with rename of internals


These release merely by changing "LISPCORE" to "Lisp>Harmony":

LispCore>Doc	documentation about the release
LISPCORE>DLION	dlion microcode
LISPCORE>DLIONINITIAL>SHUGART>KLAMATH  sources for Lisp11SAx000Initial.db
LISPCORE>DLIONINITIAL>TRIDENT>KLAMATH 	sources for Lisp11TriInitial.db
LISPCORE>LIBRARY 	sources, .DCOM and documentation for library
LISPCORE>LISPUSERS  new versions of LispUsers packages coordinated with Harmony
LISPCORE>MASS 	new version of MicroAssembler, destined to getting back into SDD
LISPCORE>MESA	
LISPCORE>MESASOURCES>* (several subdirectories)
LISPCORE>SOURCES 
LISPCORE>UCODE environment for compiling dolphin/dorado microcode
LISPCORE>BCPL	environment for making Lisp.RUN for Dolphin/Dorado
LISPCORE>DLIONDOMINO sources for domino (8085 code in DLion)
LISPCORE>DEMO needs to be cleaned up; some go on LispUsers, some on 

This should be archived and deleted:

LISPCORE>DLISP  Warren Teitelman's DLisp sources

The following should be cleaned up, moved to other directories, private directories, or deleted:

LISPCORE>DIG  temporary working directory -- clean up when DIG released
LISPCORE>DLIONINITIAL>TRIDENT>SIERRA  obsolete, archive & delete
LISPCORE>DRAWFILES contains a few hacks, can read in with READDRAW and show on iris?
LISPCORE>INTERPRESS temporary working directory
LISPCORE>MAIL => LISPCORE>INTERNAL>MAIL (??)
LISPCORE>MISC I guess some of the other stuff can go here. Need to clean out junk from here
LISPCORE>NEW temporary working directory
LISPCORE>NEW>ARCHIVE temporary working directory
LISPCORE>OLDDOC  old documentation files which need to be cleaned up and rewritten, etc.
LISPCORE>ONCOCIN was for ONCOCIN demo. Has some files which we may want to import
LISPCORE>TEST some old test files
LISPCORE>UNKNOWN apropriate name, but should be cleaned up...

plus any file on <LispCore> not on a subdirectory.

Some files on <Lisp>Carol>* and <Lisp>Fugue.6>* should be moved forward to <Lisp>Harmony> if they don't appear on LispCore
