This is a tool for those who use both Interlisp-D and XDE. It is similar to Install and friends, except that it is used for installing Interlisp-D virtual memory image files. (For more details about running Interlisp-D at Xerox, contact LispSupport.PA; it requires a DLion with at least 1.5 MB of memory and at least 13000 free pages in a single volume. You must install new Initial microcode Lisp11sax000Initial.db before running Interlisp.)
 
The syntax is:

InstallLisp volumeName _ fileName/switches
	
volumeName is the name of the volume that you want the Lisp installed on; fileName is the name of the source file, which may be either local or remote.  Switches may be one or more of the following:

      /d - set to default boot-lisp (the lisp that will be run when 0-booted)
      /s - start the lisp after installation
      /x - expand file to fill volume (you should always do this)
      
To combine switches, do not duplicate the slashes.  (to specify all switches, use /dsx).
An alternative command format,

        > InstallLisp volumeName/switches

allows one to apply the switches to the file that is already on a volume.

Examples:

	>InstallLisp User _ [eris]<Lisp>Harmony>Basics>Full.sysout/xs

Bring over and install Interlisp on the User volume, and boot it when done.

	>InstallLisp Lisp _ Lisp.sysout/XS

if you keep a copy in Tajo

  > InstallLisp Lisp _ [Eris]<Lisp>Harmony>Basics>Full.sysout 

	will install the "Harmony" release, as will

  > InstallLisp Lisp _ [Phylex:PARC:Xerox]<Lisp>Harmony>Basics>Full.Sysout

  > InstallLisp User/s

     will merely start the Lisp which was installed on the "User" volume.
