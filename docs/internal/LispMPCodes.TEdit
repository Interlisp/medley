Maintenance Panel Error Code Summary for Xerox 1108 Interlisp-D There are two types of maintenance panel codes: progress codes and error codes.  Progress codes are placed in the Maintenance Panel at various stages of initialization.  Error codes are traps which freeze or blink the error number in the maintenance panel.  All errors except the 9000-range errors are fatal.Summary of MP code ranges0000-0499 boot-time diagnostics0500-0699 IOP code0700-0899 Pilot microcode0900-0999 Pilot1000-6999 tech-rep diagnostics7000-8887 Star8888-8888 MP lamp test9000-9999 LispBoot-time errors0096	Insufficient real memory (<1MByte) for lisp0149	Usually right after power-on.

Most are "should never happen" cases that indicate a serious error; but some (in particular, 9305 and 9318) may be much less serious.  If possible, use TeleRaid to find out more information (press the Undo key to enter the TeleRaid server (cursor changes into "TeleRaid"), and run the TeleRaid user from another machine).  Even if you can't TeleRaid from another machine, several of these codes you can convert into a Lisp break if the world is still mostly consistent and the error occurred under user code (rather than, say, the garbage collector): type ^B to the TeleRaid server.  Summary of TeleRaid server commands:^B	attempt to enter Break.  If error is in a special system context, will change cursor to "CANT", indicating refusal to enter break.  Warning: even if the system is willing to try to enter a break, it may fail, leaving your system unrestartable.  When in doubt, use ^D.^D	perform Hard Resetclear stack, flush all non-restartable processes.^N	continue from error.  Warning: You should not use this command except for the following errors: 9318 (when you believe it be be continuable, see below); 9915 error when caused by typing the Raid interrupt; 9325; 9326; 9329.^P	display Pup host number (in decimal) in maintenance panel.9302	Invalid Vmem: attempt to boot an image that is not a valid Lisp sysout, or which is inconsistent from having some, but not all, of its dirty pages written.  Can happen if you boot instead of calling LOGOUT.  Usually caught sooner as code 217.9303	"No place for IOCB page at startup"this usually only happens if your machine has insufficient memory.9304	Obsolete [Map out of bounds].9305	Invalid address: attempt to use a pointer that does not refer to an existing (allocated) part of virtual memory.  Usually means garbage was fetched from somewhere that should have contained a pointer; a common source is code with type checking turned off attempting to fetch a datatype field from an object that is not a datatype, such as NIL or a small integer.  This error can often be converted to a break with the ^B TeleRaid command if the Lisp image is otherwise in a good state.9306	Obsolete [Invalid virtual page]. 9307	"Unavailable page on real page chain"inconsistent state in page fault handler.9308	"Loop in \SELECTREALPAGE"inconsistent state in page fault handler.9309	Attempt to allocate already existing page (from call to \NEWPAGE).9310	A 9309 error recursively inside the new page allocator.9311	"Locked page occupies a file page needed to lock another"bad state in virtual memory system.9312	Arg to CLOCK0 not an integer box.9313	Fault on resident page: processor took a page fault for a page that appears to be resident.9314	PageFault on stack: shouldn't happen, as stack is resident.9316	Obsolete [Attempt to extend vmem beyond 8MB].9317	"Attempt to write a locked page when not under \FLUSHVM"bad state in virtual memory system.9318	Error in uninterruptable system code: an error that ordinarily would enter a break (e.g., a type test failure), but in a piece of code that should not be user-interruptable.  This is generally a sign that some datum used by system code has been smashed, but this is not always fatal.  Should you not be in a position to diagnose the error with TeleRaid, you can type ^N after entering the TeleRaid server; Lisp will proceed from the MP halt and attempt to enter a break anyway, from which (if it succeeds) you might be able to glean more information about the problem.  Warning: continuing with ^N can be fatal if the error really was in a place where a break would not succeed.9319	Stack full: hard stack overflow.  A soft stack overflow (Lisp break "STACK FULL") occurs when the stack is mostly used up; if you proceed beyond that point without resetting you can completely fill the stack and get this MP code.  Press STOP to perform a HARDRESET to clear the stack, or run TeleRaid to find out who was guilty of overflowing the stack.9320	Storage is completely full.  A continuable Lisp break "STORAGE FULL" occurs when the allocation space is nearly full.9321	Unknown UFN: attempt to execute an unimplemented opcode.  This usually means that the processor is trying to execute random memory, or took a wild jump somewhere.  Often a microcode bug.9322	Atoms full: the limit on number of litatoms (2^16) has been reached.9323	Obsolete [Pnames full].9324	Stack frame use count overflow: the program has attempted to create more than 200 references to the same stack frame.9325	Storage nearly full: this is a warning that comes later than the "STORAGE FULL" break but before you completely run out (and get a 9320).  You can continue from this error with ^N from TeleRaid.9326	Bad MDS free list: the free list of recycled MDS pages got trashed.  You can continue from this error with ^N from TeleRaid.9327	Bad array block.  The array allocator found a bad array block in its free list.  Generally means some unsafe code trashed one or more locations in array space.9328	A variation on 9327.9329	The garbage collector attempted to reclaim an array block, but the block's header was trashed.  You can continue from this error with ^N from TeleRaid, but it is symptomatic of array trashing, and you should save your state as soon as possible and restart in a good sysout.9330	Reference counting problem: an object marked as having a overflowed reference count (greater than 62) is not found in the overflow table.9331	Reference counting problem: an object whose reference count just now overflowed was already in the overflow table.9332	Reference counting problem: an attempt was made to decrement the reference count of an object whose reference count was already zero.9333	One of a number of consistency checks in the process manager failed.9334	The process manager needed to build a function frame for some operation, but failed.  This normally should never happen, but could conceivably if you are about to completely fill up the stack (and thus would otherwise get a 9319 error).9335	Occurs at boot time when the sysout you are trying to run uses the full 32MB virtual address space, but you are trying to run it on a machine that can only address 8MB.  The function 32MBADDRESSABLE reports whether a machine has the hardware required to address 32MB.9336	Somehow control was transferred to the T frame at the top of the world (effectively a (RETTO T), except that RETTO turns that case into a RESET), thereby evading the process world.  This leaves the stack in an unresumable state.9337	The process that is being scheduled to run next has had its stack releasedinconsistent state in the process scheduler.9393	(Koto Only) See 9341	Post-Koto Error Codes9338-40	Error in locked page logicnot currently used.9341	Hard disk error in the swapperthe swapper has tried several times to access a page of the virtual memory backing file and failed; page fault cannot proceed.9342	Disk run table for the virtual memory backing file is malformed.9400-9899 unassigned9900-9924 Attempt to call Raid or 1132 Subr.The only code normally seen in this range is 9915:9915	Call to RAID.  Note that if you have the Raid interrupt enabled (typically on ^C), you will get a 9915 error by typing that interrupt character, which you can continue by typing ^N from TeleRaid.  Any other occurrence of 9915 generally signifies an error in system code that has not been explicitly assigned a code in the 9300 range.       1   $          $  ê                          1   $          $  ê                          ( $ H                                ( $ H                                1   $‘        $  ê                          (                                    (   $                                1   ®‘        0  ®                          1   ê‘        $  ê                          1   0‘        0  ¥                          1   $‘        $  ê                          1   0‘        $  ê                          1   $‘        $  ê                          (    ‘                               (    ‘                              (                                     (                                            
