\f[B]medley\f[R] \[em] starts up Medley Interlisp
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]medley\f[R] [ flags \&... ] [ \f[I]SYSOUT_FILE\f[R] ] [ \-\-
\f[I]PASS_ON_ARGS\f[R] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Starts Medley Interlisp in a window.
.PP
Note: \f[B]$MEDLEYDIR\f[R] is an environment variable set by Medley and
used by many of the options described below.
MEDLEYDIR is the top level directory of the Medley installation that
contains the specific medley script that is invoked after all symbolic
links are resolved.
In the standard global installation this will be
/usr/local/interlisp/medley.
But Medley can be installed in multiple places on any given machine and
hence MEDLEYDIR is computed on each invocation of medley.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\ 
.SS Flags
.PP
\ 
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
prints out a brief summary of the flags and arguments to medley.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-full
Start Medley from the standard \[lq]full\[rq] sysout.
full.sysout includes a complete Interlisp and CommonLisp environment
with a standard set of development tools.
It does not include any of the applications built using Medley.
(See \f[I]SYSOUT_FILE\f[R] below for more information on starting
sysouts.)
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-lisp
Start Medley from the standard \[lq]lisp\[rq] sysout.
lisp.sysout only includes the basic Interlisp and CommonLisp
environment.
(See \f[I]SYSOUT_FILE\f[R] below for more information on starting
sysouts.)
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-apps
Start Medley from the standard \[lq]apps\[rq] sysout.
apps.sysout includes everything in full.sysout plus Medley applications
including Notecards, Rooms and CLOS.
It also includes pre\-installed links to key Medley documentation.
(See \f[I]SYSOUT_FILE\f[R] below for more information on starting
sysouts.)
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-interlisp (relevent only when \-\-apps is specified)
Make the initial Exec window within Medley be an Interlisp Exec.
Default is to start in an XCL Exec.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-noscroll
Ordinarily Medley displays scroll bars to enable the user to pan the
Medley virtual display within the Medley window.
This is true even when the entire virtual display fits within the
window.
Specifying \-\-noscroll turns off the scroll bars.
Note: If \-\-noscroll is specified and the virtual screen is larger than
the window, there will be no way to pan to the non\-visible parts of the
virtual display.
.TP
.B \-g \f[I]WxH\f[R], \-\-geometry \f[I]WxH\f[R]
Sets the size of the X Window (or VNC window) that Medley runs in to be
Width x Height.
(Full X Windows geomtery specification with +X+Y is not currently
supported).
If \-\-geometry is not specified but \-\-screensize is, then the window
size will be determined based on the \-\-screensize values and the
\-\-noscroll flag.
If neither \-\-geometry nor \-\-screensize is provided, then the window
size is set to 1440x900 if \-\-noscroll is set and 1462x922 if
\-\-noscroll is not set.
.TP
.B \-s \f[I]WxH\f[R], \-\-screensize \f[I]WxH\f[R]
Sets the size of the virtual display as seen from Medley\[cq]s point of
view.
The Medley window is an unscaled viewport onto this virtual display.
If \-\-screensize is not specified but \-\-geometry is, then the virtual
display size will be set so that the entire virtual display fits into
the given window geometry.
If neither \-\-screensize nor \-\-geometry is provided, then the screen
size is set to 1440x900.
.TP
.B \-t \f[I]STRING\f[R], \-\-title \f[I]STRING\f[R]
Use STRING as title of Medley window.
Not relevent when the \-\-vnc flag is set.
.TP
.B \-d \f[I]:N\f[R], \-\-display \f[I]:N\f[R]
Use X display :N.
Defaults to the value of $DISPLAY.
Not relevant when the \-\-vnc flag is set.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-vnc (Applicable only to Windows System for Linux installations)
Use a VNC window running on the Windows side instead of an X window.
The VNC window will folllow the Windows desktop scaling setting allowing
for much more usable Medley on high resolution displays.
On WSL, X windows do not scale well.
.TP
.B \-i [\f[I]ID_STRING\f[R] | \- | \-\-], \-\-id [\f[I]ID_STRING\f[R] | \- | \-\-]
Use ID_STRING as the id for this run of Medley, iunless ID_STRING is
\[lq]\-\[rq] or \[lq]\-\-\[rq].
If ID_STRING is \[lq]\-\[rq], then use the basename of $MEDLEYDIR as the
id.
If ID_STRING is \[lq]\-\-\[rq], then use the basename of the parent
directory of $MEDLEYDIR as the id.
Only one instance of Medley with a given id can run at a time.
The id is used to distinguish the virtual memory stores so that multiple
instances of Medley can run simultaneously.
Default id is \[lq]default\[rq].
.TP
.B \-m \f[I]N\f[R], \-\-mem \f[I]N\f[R]
Set Medley to run in N MB of virtual memory.
Defaults to 256MB.
.TP
.B \-p \f[I]FILE\f[R], \-\-vmem \f[I]FILE\f[R]
Use FILE as the Medley virtual memory (vmem) store.
FILE must be writeable by the current user.
Care must be taken not to use the same vmem FILE for two instances of
Medley running simultaneously.
The \-\-id flag will not protect against vmem collisions when the
\-\-vmem flag is used.
Default is to store the vmem in LOGINDIR/vmem/lisp_XXX.virtualmem, where
XXX is the id of this Medley run (see \-\-id flag above).
See \-\-logindir below for setting of LOGINDIR.
.TP
.B \-r [\f[I]FILE\f[R] | \-], \-\-greet [\f[I]FILE\f[R] | \-]
Use FILE as the Medley greetfile, unless FILE is \[lq]\-\[rq] in which
case Medley will start up without using a greetfile.
The default Medley greetfile is $MEDLEYDIR/greetfiles/MEDLEYDIR\-INIT,
except when the \-\-apps flag is used in which case it is
$MEDLEYDIR/greetfiles/APPS\-INIT.
.TP
.B \-x [\f[I]DIR\f[R] | \-], \-\-logindir [\f[I]DIR\f[R] | \-]
use DIR as LOGINDIR in Medley, unless DIR is \[lq]\-\[rq], in which case
use $MEDLEYDIR/logindir.
DIR (or $MEDLEYDIR/logindir) must be writeable by the current user.
LOGINDIR defaults to $HOME/il.
LOGINDIR is used by Medley as the working directory on start\-up and
where it loads any \[lq]personal\[rq] initialization file from.
.SS Other Options
.PP
\ 
.TP
.B \f[I]SYSOUT_FILE\f[R]
The pathname of the file to use as a sysout for Medley to start from.
If SYSOUT_FILE is not provided and none of the flags (\-\-apps,
\-\-full, \-\-lisp) is used, then Medley will start from the saved
virtual memory file from the previous session with the same ID_STRING as
this run.
If no such virtual memory file exists, then Medley will start from the
standard full.sysout (equivalent to specifying the \-\-full flag).
.TP
.B \f[I]PASS_ON_ARGS\f[R]
All arguments after the \[lq]\-\-\[rq] flag, are passed unaltered to lde
via run\-medley.
