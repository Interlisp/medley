INTERLISP-D REFERENCE MANUALFUNCTION DEFINITION, MANIPULATION AND EVALUATION"10"FUNCTION DEFINITION, MANIPULATION AND EVALUATION3  Medley is designed to help you define and debug functions.  Developing an applications program with Medley involves defining a number of functions in terms of the system primitives and other user-defined functions.  Once defined, your functions may be used exactly like Interlisp primitive functions, so the programming process can be viewed as extending the Interlisp language to include the required functionality.A function's definition specifies if the function has a fixed or variable number of arguments, whether these arguments are evaluated or not, the function argument names, and a series of forms which define the behavior of the function.  For example:(LAMBDA (X Y) (PRINT X) (PRINT Y))This function has two evaluated arguments, X and Y, and it will execute (PRINT X) and (PRINT Y) when evaluated.  Other types of function definitions are described below.A function is defined by putting an expr definition in the function definition cell of a symbol.  There are a number of functions for accessing and setting function definition cells, but one usually defines a function with DEFINEQ (see the Defining Functions section below).  For example:¬ (DEFINEQ (FOO (LAMBDA (X Y) (PRINT X) (PRINT Y))))(FOO)The expression above will define the function FOO to have the expr definition (LAMBDA (X Y) (PRINT X) (PRINT Y)).  After being defined, this function may be evaluated just like any system function:¬ (FOO 3 (IPLUS 3 4))377Not all function definition cells contain expr definitions.  The compiler (see the first page of Chapter 18) translates expr definitions into compiled code objects, which execute much faster.  Interlisp provides a number of ªfunction type functionsº which determine how a given function is defined, the number and names of function arguments, etc.  See the Function Type Functions section below.Usually, functions are evaluated automatically when they appear within another function or when typed into Interlisp.  However, sometimes it is useful to envoke the Interlisp interpreter explicitly to apply a given ªfunctional argumentº to some data.  There are a number of functions which will apply a given function repeatedly.  For example, MAPCAR will apply a function (or an expr definition) to all of the elements of a list, and return the values returned by the function:¬ (MAPCAR '(1 2 3 4 5) '(LAMBDA (X) (ITIMES X X))(1 4 9 16 25)When using functional arguments, there are a number of problems which can arise, related to accessing free variables from within a function argument.  Many times these problems can be solved using the function FUNCTION to create a FUNARG object.The macro facility provides another way of specifying the behavior of a function (see the Macros section below).  Macros are very useful when developing code which should run very quickly, which should be compiled differently than when it is interpreted, or which should run differently in different implementations of Interlisp.Function Types1Interlisp functions are defined using list expressions called ªexpr definitions.º  An expr definition is a list of the form (LAMBDA-WORD ARG-LIST FORM1 ... FORMN).  LAMBDA-WORD determines whether the arguments to this function will be evaluated or not.  ARG-LIST determines the number and names of arguments.  FORM1 ... FORMN are a series of forms to be evaluated after the arguments are bound to the local variables in ARG-LIST.If LAMBDA-WORD is the symbol LAMBDA, then the arguments to the function are evaluated.  If LAMBDA-WORD is the symbol NLAMBDA, then the arguments to the function are not evaluated.  Functions which evaluate or don't evaluate their arguments are therefore known as ªlambdaº or ªnlambdaº functions, respectively.If ARG-LIST is NIL or a list of symbols, this indicates a function with a fixed number of arguments.  Each symbol is the name of an argument for the function defined by this expression.  The process of binding these symbols to the individual arguments is called ªspreadingº the arguments, and the function is called a ªspreadº function.  If the argument list is any symbol other than NIL, this indicates a function with a variable number of arguments, known as a ªnospreadº function.If ARG-LIST is anything other than a symbol or a list of symbols, such as (LAMBDA "FOO" ...), attempting to use this expr definition will generate an Arg not symbol error.  In addition, if NIL or T is used as an argument name, the error Attempt to bind NIL or T is generated.These two parameters (lambda/nlambda and spread/nospread) may be specified independently, so there are four nain function types, known as lambda-spread, nlanbda-spread, lanbda-nospread, and nlambda-nospread functions.  Each one has a different form and is used for a different purpose.  These four function types are described more fully below.For lambda-spread, lanbda-nospread, or nlambda-spread functions, there is an upper limit to the number of arguments that a function can have, based on the number of arguments that can be stored on the stack on any one function call.  Currently, the limit is 80 arguments.  If a function is called with more than that many arguments, the error Too many arguments occurs.  However, nlambda-nospread functions can be called with an arbitrary number of arguments, since the arguments are not individually saved on the stack.  Lambda-Spread Functions(LAMBDA-SPREAD% FUNCTIONS NIL Lambda-Spread% Functions NIL ("10") 2)Lambda-spread functions take a fixed number of evaluated arguments.  This is the most common function type.  A lambda-spread expr definition has the form:(LAMBDA (ARG1 ... ARGM) FORM1 ... FORMN)The argument list (ARG1 ... ARGM) is a list of symbols that gives the number and names of the formal arguments to the function.  If the argument list is ( ) or NIL, this indicates that the function takes no arguments.  When a lambda-spread function is applied to some arguments, the arguments are evaluated, and bound to the local variables ARG1 ... ARGM.  Then, FORM1 ... FORMN are evaluated in order, and the value of the function is the value of FORMN.¬ (DEFINEQ (FOO (LAMBDA (X Y) (LIST X Y))))(FOO)¬ (FOO 99 (PLUS 3 4))(99 7)In the above example, the function FOO defined by (LAMBDA (X Y) (LIST X Y)) is applied to the arguments 99 and (PLUS 3 4).  These arguments are evaluated (giving 99 and 7), the local variable X is bound to 99 and Y to 7, (LIST X Y) is evaluated, returning (99 7), and this is returned as the value of the function.A standard feature of the Interlisp system is that no error occurs if a spread function is called with too many or too few arguments.  If a function is called with too many argumnents, the extra arguments are evaluated but ignored.  If a function is called with too few arguments, the unsupplied ones will be delivered as NIL.  In fact, a spread function cannot distinguish between being given NIL as an argument, and not being given that argument, e.g., (FOO) and (FOO NIL) are exactly the same for spread functions.  If it is necessary to distinguish between these two cases, use an nlambda function and explicitly evaluate the arguments with the EVAL function.Nlambda-Spread Functions(NLAMBDA-SPREAD% FUNCTIONS NIL Nlambda-Spread% Functions NIL ("10") 3)Nlambda-spread functions take a fixed number of unevaluated arguments.  An nlambda-spread expr definition has the form:(NLAMBDA (ARG1 ... ARGM) FORM1 ... FORMN)Nlambda-spread functions are evaluated similarly to lanbda-spread functions, except that the arguments are not evaluated before being bound to the variables ARG1 ... ARGM.¬ (DEFINEQ (FOO (NLAMBDA (X Y) (LIST X Y))))(FOO)¬ (FOO 99 (PLUS 3 4))(99 (PLUS 3 4))In the above example, the function FOO defined by (NLAMBDA (X Y) (LIST X Y)) is applied to the arguments 99 and (PLUS 3 4).  These arguments are unevaluated to X and Y.   (LIST X Y) is evaluated, returning (99 (PLUS 3 4)), and this is returned as the value of the function.Functions can be defined so that all of their arguments are evaluated (lambda functions) or none are evaluated (nlambda functions).  If it is desirable to write a function which only evaluates some of its arguments (e.g., SETQ), the functions should be defined as an nlambda, with some arguments explicitly evaluated using the function EVAL.  If this is done, the user should put the symbol EVAL on the property list of the function under the property INFO.  This informs various system packages, such as DWIM, CLISP, and Masterscope, that this function in fact does evaluate its arguments, even though it is an nlambda.Warning:  A frequent problem that occurs when evaluating arguments to nlambda functions with EVAL is that the form being evaluated may reference variables that are not accessible within the nlambda function.  This is usually not a problem when interpreting code, but when the code is compiled, the values of ªlocalº variables may not be accessible on the stack (see Chapter 18).  The system nlambda functions that evaluate their arguments (such as SETQ) are expanded in-line by the compiler, so this is not a problem.  Using the macro facility is recommended in cases where it is necessary to evaluate some arguments to an nlambda function.Lambda-Nospread Functions(LAMBDA-NOSPREAD% FUNCTIONS NIL Lambda-Nospread% Functions NIL ("10") 3)Lambda-nospread functions take a variable number of evaluated arguments.  A lambda-nospread expr definition has the form:(LAMBDA VAR FORM1 ... FORMN)VAR may be any symbol, except NIL and T.  When a lambda-nospread function is applied to some arguments, each of these arguments is evaluated and the values stored on the stack.  VAR is then bound to the number of arguments which have been evaluated.  For example, if FOO is defined by (LAMBDA X ...), when (FOO A B C) is evaluated, A, B, and C are evaluated and X is bound to 3.  VAR should never be resetThe following functions are used for accessing the arguments of lambda-nospread functions.(ARG(ARG (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 4) VAR M)  	[NLambda Function]Returns the Mth argument for the lambda-nospread function whose argument list is VAR.  VAR is the name of the atomic argument list to a lambda-nospread function, and is not evaluated.  M is the number of the desired argument, and is evaluated.  The value of ARG is undefined for M less than or equal to 0 or greater than the value of VAR.(SETARG(SETARG (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 4) VAR M X)  	[NLambda Function]Sets the Mth argument for the lambda-nospread function whose argument list is VAR to X.  VAR is not evaluated;  M and X are evaluated.  M should be between 1 and the value of VAR.In the example below, the function FOO is defined to collect and return a list of all of the evaluated arguments it is given (the value of the for statement).¬ (DEFINEQ (FOO   (LAMBDA X (for ARGNUM from 1 to X collect (ARG X ARGNUM)](FOO)¬ (FOO 99 (PLUS 3 4))(99 7)¬ (FOO 99 (PLUS 3 4)(TIMES 3 4)))(99 7 12)NLambda-Nospread Functions(NLAMBDA-NOSPREAD% FUNCTIONS NIL NLambda-Nospread% Functions NIL ("10") 4)Nlambda-nospread functions take a variable number of unevaluated arguments.  An nlambda-nospread expr definition has the form:(NLAMBDA VAR FORM1 ... FORMN)VAR may be any symbol, except NIL and T.  Though similar in form to lambda-nospread expr definitions, an nlambda-nospread is evaluated quite differently.  When an nlambda-nospread function is applied to some arguments, VAR is simply bound to a list of the unevaluated arguments.  The user may pick apart this list, and evaluate different arguments.In the example below, FOO is defined to return the reverse of the list of arguments it is given (unevaluated):¬ (DEFINEQ (FOO (NLAMBDA X (REVERSE X)))) (FOO)¬ (FOO 99 (PLUS 3 4))((PLUS 3 4) 99)¬ (FOO 99 (PLUS 3 4)(TIMES 3 4))(TIMES 3 4)(PLUS 3 4) 99)The warning about evaluating arguments to nlambda functions also applies to nlambda-nospread function.  Compiled Functions(COMPILED% FUNCTIONS NIL Compiled% Functions NIL ("10") 5)Functions defined by expr definitions can be compiled by the Interlisp compiler (see Chapter 18).  The compiler produces compiled code objects (of data type CCODEP) which execute more quickly than the corresponding expr definition code.  Functions defined by compiled code objects may have the same four types as expr definitions (lambda/nlambda, spread/nospread).  Functions created by the compiler are referred to as compiled functions.Function Type FunctionsThere are a variety of functions used for examining the type, argument list, etc. of functions.  These functions may be given either a symbol  (in which case they obtain the function definition from the definition cell), or a function definition itself.(FNTYP(FNTYP (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 5) FN)  	[Function]Returns NIL if FN is not a function definition or the name of a defined function.  Otherwise, FNTYP returns one of the following symbols, depending on the type of function definition.	EXPR	Lambda-spread expr definition	CEXPR	Lambda-spread compiled definition	FEXPR	Nlambda-spread expr definition	CFEXPR	Nlambda-spread compiled definition	EXPR*	Lambda-nospread expr definition	CEXPR*	Lambda-nospread compiled definition		FEXPR*	Nlambda-nospread expr definition	CFEXPR*	Nlambda-nospread compiled definition	FUNARG	FNTYP returns the symbol FUNARG if FN is a FUNARG expression.EXP, FEXPR, EXPR*, and FEXPR* indicate that FN is defined by an expr definition.  CEXPR, CFEXPR, CEXPR*, and CFEXPR* indicate that FN is defined by a compiled definition, as indicated by the prefix C.  The suffix * indicates that FN has an indefinite number of arguments, i.e., is a nospread function.  The prefix F indicates unevaluated arguments.  Thus, for example, a CFEXPR* is a compiled nospread nlambda function.(EXPRP(EXPRP (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 5) FN)  	[Function]Returns T if (FNTYP FN) is EXPR, FEXPR, EXPR*, or FEXPR*;  NIL otherwise.  However, (EXPRP FN) is also true if FN is (has) a list definition, even if it does not begin with LAMBDA or NLAMBDA.  In other words, EXPRP is not quite as selective as FNTYP.(CCODEP(CCODEP (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 5) FN)  	[Function]Returns T if (FNTYP FN) is either CEXPR, CFEXPR, CEXPR*, or CFEXPR*;  NIL otherwise. (ARGTYPE(ARGTYPE (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 6) FN)  	[Function]FN is the name of a function or its definition.  ARGTYPE returns 0, 1, 2, or 3, or NIL if FN is not a function.   ARGTYPE corresponds to the rows of FNTYPs.   The interpretation of this value is as follows:	0	Lambda-spread function (EXPR, CEXPR)	1	Nlambda-spread function (FEXPR, CFEXPR) 	2	Lambda-nospread function (EXPR*, CEXPR*)		3	Nlambda-nospread function (FEXPR*, CFEXPR*)(NARGS(NARGS (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 6) FN)  	[Function]Returns the number of arguments of FN, or NIL if FN is not a function.  If FN is a nospread function, the value of NARGS is 1.(ARGLIST(ARGLIST (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 6) FN)  	[Function]Returns the ªargument listº for FN.  Note that the ªargument listº is a symbol for nospread functions.  Since NIL is a possible value for ARGLIST, the error Args not available is generated if FN is not a function.If FN is a compiled function, the argument list is constructed, i.e., each call to ARGLIST requires making a new list.  For functions defined by expr definitions, lists beginning with LAMBDA or NLAMBDA, the argument list is simply CADR of GETD.  If FN has an expr definition, and CAR of the definition is not LAMBDA or NLAMBDA, ARGLIST will check to see if CAR of the definition is a member of LAMBDASPLST (see Chapter 20).  If it is, ARGLIST presumes this is a function object the user is defining via DWIMUSERFORMS, and simply returns CADR of the definition as its argument list.  Otherwise ARGLIST generates an error as described above.(SMARTARGLIST(SMARTARGLIST (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 6) FN EXPLAINFLG TAIL)  	[Function]A ªsmartº version of ARGLIST that tries various strategies to get the arglist of FN.First SMARTARGLIST checks the property list of FN under the property ARGNAMES.  For spread functions, the argument list itself is stored.  For nospread functions, the form is (NIL ARGLIST1 . ARGLIST2), where ARGLIST1 is the value SMARTARGLIST should return when EXPLAINFLG = T, and ARGLIST2 the value when EXPLAINFLG = NIL.  For example, (GETPROP 'DEFINEQ 'ARGNAMES) = (NIL (X1 Xl ... XN) . X).  This allows the user to specify special argument lists.Second, if FN is not defined as a function, SMARTARGLIST attempts spelling correction on FN by calling FNCHECK (see Chapter 20), passing TAIL to be used for the call to FIXSPELL.  If unsuccessful, the FN Not a function error will be generated.Third, if FN is known to the file package (see Chapter 17) but not loaded in, SMARTARGLIST will obtain the arglist information from the file.Otherwise, SMARTARGLIST simply returns (ARGLIST FN).SMARTARGLIST is used by BREAK (see Chapter 15) and ADVISE with EXPLAINFLG = NIL for constructing equivalent expr definitions, and by the TTYIN in-line command ?= (see Chapter 26), with EXPLAINFLG = T. Defining Functions1Function definitions are stored in a ªfunction definition cellº associated with each symbol.  This cell is directly accessible via the two functions PUTD and GETD (see below), but it is usually easier to define functions with DEFINEQ:(DEFINEQ(DEFINEQ (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 7) X1 X2 ... XN)  	[NLambda NoSpread Function]DEFINEQ is the function normally used for defining functions.  It takes an indefinite number of arguments which are not evaluated.  Each Xi must be a list defining one function, of the form (NAME DEFINITION).  For example:(DEFINEQ (DOUBLE (LAMBDA (X) (IPLUS X X))))The above expression will define the function DOUBLE with the expr definition (LAMBDA (X) (IPLUS X X)).  Xi may also have the form (NAME ARGS . DEF-BODY), in which case an appropriate lambda expr definition will be constructed.  Therefore, the above expression is exactly the same as:(DEFINEQ (DOUBLE (X) (IPLUS X X)))Note that this alternate form can only be used for lambda functions.  The first form must be used to define an nlambda function.DEFINEQ returns a list of the names of the functions defined.ÿÿ   ( D E F I N E(DEFINE (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 7)ÿÿ    X  ï% )     	 [ F u n c t i o n ]ÿ Lambda-spread version of DEFINEQ.  Each element of the list X is itself a list either of the form (NAME DEFINITION) or (NAME ARGS . DEF-BODY).  DEFINE will generate an error, Incorrect defining form on encountering an atom where a defining list is expected.DEFINE and DEFINEQ operate correctly if the function is already defined and BROKEN, ADVISED, or BROKEN-IN.For expressions involving type-in only, if the time stamp facility is enabled (see the Time Stamps section of Chapter 16), both DEFINE and DEFINEQ stamp the definition with your initials and date.UNSAFE.TO.MODIFY.FNS(UNSAFE.TO.MODIFY.FNS (Variable) NIL NIL ("10") 7)  	[Variable]Value is a list of functions that should not be redefined, because doing so may cause unusual bugs (or crash the system!).  If you try to modify a function on this list (using DEFINEQ, TRACE, etc), the system prints Warning: XXX may be unsafe to modify -- continue?  If you type Yes, the function is modified, otherwise an error occurs.  This provides a measure of safety for novices who may accidently redefine important system functions.  You can add your own functions onto this list.By convention, all functions starting with the character backslash (ª\º) are system internal functions, which you should never redefine or modify.  Backslash functions are not on UNSAFE.TO.MODIFY.FNS, so trying to redefine them will not cause a warning.DFNFLG(DFNFLG (Variable) NIL NIL ("10") 8)  	[Variable]DFNFLG is a global variable that affects the operation of DEFINEQ and DEFINE.  If DFNFLG=NIL, an attempt to redefine a function FN will cause DEFINE to print the message (FN REDEFINED) and to save the old definition of FN using SAVEDEF (see the Functions for Manipulating Typed Definitions section of Chapter 17) before redefining it (except if the old and new definitions are EQUAL, in which case the effect is simply a no-op).  If DFNFLG=T, the function is simply redefined.  If DFNFLG=PROP or ALLPROP, the new definition is stored on the property list under the property EXPR.  ALLPROP also affects the operation of RPAQQ and RPAQ (see the Functions Used Within Source Files section of Chapter 17).  DFNFLG is initially NIL.DFNFLG is reset by LOAD (see the Loading Files section of Chapter 17) to enable various ways of handling the defining of functions and setting of variables when loading a file.  For most applications, the user will not reset DFNFLG directly.Note:  The compiler does not respect the value of DFNFLG when it redefines functions to their compiled definitions (see the first page of Chapter 18).  Therefore, if you set DFNFLG to PROP to completely avoid inadvertantly redefining something in your running system, you must use compile mode F, not ST.Note that the functions SAVEDEF and UNSAVEDEF (see the Functions for Manipulating Typed Definitions section of Chapter 17) can be useful for ªsavingº and restoring function definitions from property lists.(GETD(GETD (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 8) FN)  	[Function]Returns the function definition of FN.  Returns NIL if FN is not a symbol, or has no definition.GETD of a compiled function constructs a pointer to the definition, with the result that two successive calls do not necessarily produce EQ results.  EQP or EQUAL must be used to compare compiled definitions.ÿÿ   ( P U T D(PUTD (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 8)ÿÿ    F N   D E F  ï% )     	 [ F u n c t i o n ]ÿ Puts DEF into FN's function cell, and returns DEF.

If COPYFLG = T, a COPY of the definition of FROM is used.  COPYFLG =T is only meaningful for expr definitions, although MOVD works for compiled functions as well.  MOVD returns TO.COPYDEF (see the Functions for Manipulating Typed Definitions section of Chapter 17) is a higher-level function that not only moves expr definitions, but works also for variables, records, etc.ÿÿ   ( M O V D ?(MOVD?

Otherwise, does nothing and returns NIL.Function Evaluation1Usually, function application is done automatically by the Interlisp interpreter.  If a form is typed into Interlisp whose CAR is a function, this function is applied to the arguments in the CDR of the form.  These arguments are evaluated or not, and bound to the funcion parameters, as determined by the type of the function, and the body of the function is evaluated.  This sequence is repeated as each form in the body of the function is evaluated.There are some situations where it is necessary to explicitly call the evaluator, and Interlisp supplies a number of functions that will do this.  These functions take ªfunctional arguments,º which may either be symbols with function definitions, or expr definition forms such as (LAMBDA (X)...), or FUNARG expressions. ÿÿ  (ÿ APPLY(APPLY (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 9) FN ARGLISTÿÿ   ï% )     	 [ F u n c t i o n ]ÿ Applies the function FN to the arguments in the list ARGLIST, and returns its value.

Therefore, lambda and nlambda functions are treated the same by APPLYÿÿ ï% l a m b d a   f u n c t i o n s   t a k e   t h e i r   a r g u m e n t s   f r o m   A R G L I S T   w i t h o u t   e v a l u a t i n g   t h e m .     F o r   e x a m p l e : ÿ ¬ (APPLY 'APPEND '((PLUS 1 2 3)(4 5 6))) (PLUS 1 2 3 4 5 6)Note that FN may explicitly evaluate one or more of its arguments itself.  For example, the system function SETQ is an nlambda function that explicitly evaluates its second argument.  Therefore, (APPLY 'SETQ '(FOO (ADD1 3)))will set FOO to 4, instead of setting it to the expression (ADD1 3).APPLY can be used for manipulating expr definitions.  For example:¬ (APPLY '(LAMBDA (X Y)(ITIMES X Y)) '(3 4))) 12ÿÿ   (ÿ APPLY*(APPLY* (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 9) FN ARG1 ARG2 ...

Note that EVAL is itself a lambda function, so its argument is first evaluated, e.g.:¬ (SETQ FOO 'ADD1 3)))(ADD1 3)¬(EVAL FOO)4¬(EVAL 'FOO)(ADD1 3)ÿÿ  (ÿ QUOTE(QUOTE (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 10) Xÿÿ  )     	 [ÿ Nlambda NoSpread ÿÿ  F u n c t i o n ]ÿ QUOTE prevents its arguments from being evaluated.  Its value is X itself, e.g., (QUOTE FOO) is FOO.Interlisp functions can either evaluate or not evaluate their arguments.  QUOTE can be used in those cases where it is desirable to specify arguments unevaluated.The single-quote character (') is defined with a read macro so it returns the next expression, wrapped in a call to QUOTE (see Chapter 25).  For example, 'FOO reads as (QUOTE FOO).  This is the form used for examples in this manual.Since giving QUOTE more than one argument is almost always a parenthese error, and one that would otherewise go undetected, QUOTE itself generates an error in this case, Parenthesis error.ÿÿ  (ÿ KWOTE(KWOTE (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 10) Xÿÿ  )     	 [ F u n c t i o n ]ÿ Value is an expression which, when evaluated, yields X.  If X is NIL or a number, this is X itself.  Otherwise (LIST (QUOTE QUOTE) X).

If any of the elements in this list are of the form (QUOTE...), the enclosing QUOTE is stripped off.  Actually, NLAMBDA.ARGS stops processing the list after the first non-quoted argument.  Therefore, whereas (NLAMBDA.ARGS '((QUOTE FOO) BAR)) -> (FOO BAR),  (NLAMBDA.ARGS '(FOO (QUOTE BAR))) -> (FOO (QUOTE BAR)).NLAMBDA.ARGS is alled by a number of nlambda functions in the system, to interpret their arguments.  For instance, the function BREAK calls NLAMBDA.ARGS so that (BREAK 'FOO) will break the function FOO, rather than the function QUOTE.ÿÿ  (ÿ EVALA(EVALA (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 10) X Aÿÿ  )     	 [ F u n c t i o n ]ÿ Simulates association list variable lookup.  X is a form, A is a list of the form:((NAME1 . VAL1) (NAME2 . VAL2)... (NAMEN . VALN))The variable names and values in A are ªspreadº on the stack, and then X is evaluated.  Therefore, any variables appearing free in X that also appears as CAR of an element of A will be given the value on the CDR of that element.ÿÿ  (ÿ DEFEVAL(DEFEVAL (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 11) TYPE FNÿÿ  )     	 [ F u n c t i o n ]ÿ Specifies how a datum of a particular type is to be evaluated.  Intended primarily for user-defined data types, but works for all data types except lists, literal atoms, and numbers.  TYPE is a type name.  FN is a function object, i.e., name of a function or a lambda expression.  Whenever the interpreter encounters a datum of the indicated type, FN is applied to the datum and its value returned as the result of the evaluation.  DEFEVAL returns the previous evaling function for this type.  If FN = NIL, DEFEVAL returns the current evaling function without changing it.  If FN = T, the evaling functions is set back to the system default (which for all data types except lists is to return the datum itself).COMPILETYPELST (see Chapter 18) permits the user to specify how a datum of a particular type is to be compiled.ÿÿ  (ÿ EVALHOOK(EVALHOOK (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 11) FORM EVALHOOKFNÿÿ  )     	 [ F u n c t i o n ]ÿ EVALHOOK evaluates the expression FORM, and returns its value.  While evaluating FORM, the function EVAL behaves in a special way.  Whenever a list other than FORM itself is to be evaluated, whether implicitly or via an explicit call to EVAL, EVALHOOKFN is invoked (it should be a function), with the form to be evaluated as its argument.  EVALHOOKFN is then responsible for evaluating the form.  Whatever is returned is assume to be the result of evaluating the form.  During the execution of EVALHOOKFN, this special evaluation is turned off.  (Note that EVALHOOK does not affect the evaluations of variables, only of lists).Here is an example of a simple tracing routine that uses the EVALHOOK feature:¬(DEFINEQ (PRINTHOOK (FORM)(printout T "eval: "FORM T)(EVALHOOK FORM (FUNCTION PRINTHOOK(PRINTHOOK)Using PRINTHOOK, one might see the following interaction:¬(EVALHOOK '(LIST (CONS 1 2)(CONS 3 4)) 'PRINTHOOK)eval: (CONS 1 2)eval: (CONS 3 4)((1.2)(3.4))Iterating and Mapping Functions1The functions below are used to evaluate a form or apply a function repeatedly.  RPT, RPTQ, and FRPTQ evaluate an expression a specified number of time.  MAP, MAPCAR, MAPLIST, etc., apply a given function repeatedly to different elements of a list, possibly constructing another list.These functions allow efficient iterative computations, but they are difficult to use.  For programming iterative computations, it is usually better to use the CLISP Iterative Statement facility (see Chapter 9), which provides a more general and complete facility for expressing iterative statements.  Whenever possible, CLISP transltes iterative statements into expressions using the functions below, so there is no efficiency loss.ÿÿ  (ÿ RPT(RPT (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 12) N FORMÿÿ  )     	 [ F u n c t i o n ]ÿ Evaluates the expression FORM, N times.  Returns the value of the last evaluation.  If N is less than or equal to 0, FORM is not evaluated, and RPT returns NIL.Before each evaluation, the local variable RPTN is bound to the number of evaluations yet to take place.  This variable can be referenced within FORM.  For example, (RPT 10 '(PRINT RPTN)) will print the numbers 10, 9...1, and return 1.ÿÿ  (ÿ RPTQ(RPTQ (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 12) N FORM1 FORM2...

That is, first it computes (MAPFN1 MAPX), and then (MAPFN1 (CDR MAPX)), etc., until MAPX becomes a non-list.  If MAPFN2 is provided, (MAPFN2 MAPX) is used instead of (CDR MAPX) for the next call for MAPFN1, e.g., if MAPFN2 were CDDR, alternate elements of the list would be skipped.  MAP returns NIL.ÿÿ  (ÿ MAPC(MAPC (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 12) MAPX MAPFN1 MAPFN2) ÿÿ      	 [ F u n c t i o n ]ÿ Identical to MAP, except that (MAPFN1 (CAR MAPX)) is computed at each iteration instead of (MAPFN1 MAPX), i.e., MAPC works on elements, MAP on tails.

MAPCONC is used when there are a variable number of elements (including none) to be inserted at each iteration.  Examples:(MAPCONC '(A B C NIL D NIL) '(LAMBDA (Y)(if (NULL Y) then NIL	else (LIST Y)))) = > (A B C D)This MAPCONC returns a list consisting of MAPX with all NILs removed.(MAPCONC '((A B) C (D E F)(G) H I) '(LAMBDA (Y)(if (LISP Y) then Y	else NIL))) = > (A B D E F G)This MAPCONC returns a linear list consisting of all the lists on MAPX.Since MAPCONC uses NCONC to string the corresponding lists together, in this example the original list will be altered to be ((A B C D E F G) C (D E F G)(G) H I).  If this is an undesirable side effect, the functional argument to MAPCONC should return instead a top level copy of the lists, i.e., (LAMBDA (Y) (if (LISTP Y) then (APPERND Y) else NIL))).ÿÿ  (ÿ MAP2C(MAP2C (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 13) MAPX MAPY MAPFN1 MAPFN2) ÿÿ      	 [ F u n c t i o n ]ÿ Identical to MAPC except MAPFN1 is a function of two arguments, and (MAPFN1 (CAR MAPX)(CAR MAPY)) is computed at each iteration.  Terminates when either MAPX or MAPY is a non-list.MAPFN2 is still a function of one argument, and is applied twice on each iteration;  (MAPFN2 MAPX) gives the new MAPX, (MAPFN2 MAPY) the new MAPY.  CDR is used if MAPFN2 is not supplied, i.e., is NIL.ÿÿ  (ÿ MAP2CAR(MAP2CAR (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 13) MAPX MAPY MAPFN1 MAPFN2) ÿÿ      	 [ F u n c t i o n ]ÿ Identical to MAPCAR except MAPFN1 is a function of two arguments, and (MAPFN1 (CAR MAPX)(CAR MAPY)) is used to assemble the new list.

For example, (EVERY '(X Y Z) 'ATOM) => T.EVERY operates by evaluating (EVERYFN1 (CAR EVERYX) EVERYX).  The second argument is passed to EVERYFN1 so that it can look at the next element on EVERYX if necessary.  If EVERYFN1 yields NIL, EVERY immediately returns NIL.  Otherwise, EVERY computes (EVERYFN2 EVERYX), or (CDR EVERYX) if EVERYFN2 = NIL, and uses this as the ªnewº EVERYX, and the process continues.  For example (EVERY X 'ATOM 'CDDR) is true if every other element of X is atomic.ÿÿ  (ÿ SOME(SOME (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 14) SOMEX SOMEFN1 SOMEFN2) ÿÿ      	 [ F u n c t i o n ]ÿ Returns the tail of SOMEX beginning with the first element that satisfies SOMEFN1, i.e., for which SOMEFN1 applied to that element is true.  Value is NIL if no such element exists.  (SOME X '(LAMBDA (Z) (EQUAL Z Y))) is equivalent to (MEMBER Y X).  SOME operates analogously to EVERY.  At each stage, (SOMEFN1 (CAR SOMEX) SOMEX) is computed, and if this not NIL, SOMEX is returned as the value of SOME.  Otherwise, (SOMEFN2 SOMEX) is computed, or (CDR SOMEX) if SOMEFN2 = NIL, and used for the next SOMEX.ÿÿ  (ÿ NOTANY(NOTANY (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 14) SOMEX SOMEFN1 SOMEFN2) ÿÿ      	 [ F u n c t i o n ]ÿ (NOT (SOME SOMEX SOMEFN1 SOMEFN2)).ÿÿ  (ÿ NOTEVERY(NOTEVERY (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 14) EVERYX EVERYFN1 EVERYFN2) ÿÿ      	 [ F u n c t i o n ]ÿ (NOT (EVERY EVERYX EVERYFN1 EVERYFN2)).ÿÿ  (ÿ MAPRINT(MAPRINT (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 14) LST FILE LEFT RIGHT SEP PFN LISPXPRINTFLG) ÿÿ      	 [ F u n c t i o n ]ÿ A general printing function.  For each element of the list LST, applies PFN to the element, and FILE.  If PFN is NIL, PRIN1 is used.  Between each application MAPRINT performs PRIN1 of SEP (or "" if SEP = NIL).  If LEFT is given, it is printed (using PRIN1) initially;  if RIGHT is given, it is printed (using PRIN1) at the end.For example, (MAPRINT X NIL '%( '%)) is equivalent to PRIN1 for lists.  To print a list with commas between each element and a final ª.º one could use (MAPRINT X T NIL '%. '%,).If LISPXPRINTFLG = T, LISPXPRIN1 (see Chapter 13) is used instead of PRIN1.Functional Arguments1The functions that call the Interlisp-D evaluator take ªfunctional arguments,º which may  be symbols with function definitions, or expr definition forms such as (LAMBDA (X) ...).The following functions are useful when one wants to supply a functional argument which will always return NIL, T, or 0.  Note that the arguments X1 ... XN to these functions are evaluated, though they are not used.ÿÿ  (ÿ NILL(NILL (NoSpread Function) NIL NIL ("10") 14) X1 ...

XN ) ÿÿ      	 [ÿ NoSpread ÿÿ  F u n c t i o n ]ÿ Returns 0.When using expr definitions as function arguments, they should be enclosed within the function FUNCTION rather than QUOTE, so that they will be compiled as separate functions.ÿÿ  (ÿ FUNCTION(FUNCTION (NLambda Function) NIL NIL ("10") 15) FN ENV ) ÿÿ      	 [ÿ NLambda ÿÿ  F u n c t i o n ]ÿ If ENV = NIL, FUNCTION is the same as QUOTE, except that it is treated differently when compiled.  Consider the function definition:(DEFINEQ (FOO (LST)(FIE LST (FUNCTION (LAMBDA (Z)(ITIMES Z Z))]FOO calls the function FIE with the value of LST and the expr definition (LAMBDA (Z)(LIST (CAR Z))).If FOO is run interpreted, it does not make any difference whether FUNCTION or QUOTE is used.  However, when FOO is compiled, if FUNCTION is used the compiler will define and compile the expr definition as an auxiliary function (see Chapter 18).  The compiled expr definition will run considerably faster, which can make a big difference if it is applied repeatedly.Compiling FUNCTION will not create an auxiliary function if it is a functional argument to a function that compiles open, such as most of the mapping functions (MAPCAR, MAPLIST, etc.).If ENV is not NIL, it can be a list of variables that are (presumably) used freely by FN.  ENV can also be an atom, in which case it is evaluated, and the value interpreted as described above.Macros1Macros provide an alternative way of specifying the action of a function.  Whereas function definitions are evaluated with a ªfunction callº, which involves binding variables and other housekeeping tasks, macros are evaluated by translating one Interlisp form into another, which is then evaluated.A symbol may have both a function definition and a macro definition.  When a form is evaluated by the interpreter, if the CAR has a function definition, it is used (with a function call), otherwise if it has a macro definition, then that is used.  However, when a form is compiled, the CAR is checked for a macro definition first, and only if there isn't one is the function definition compiled.  This allows functions that behave differently when compiled and interpreted.  For example, it is possible to define a function that, when interpreted, has a function definition that is slow and has a lot of error checks, for use when debugging a system.  This function could also have a macro definition that defines a fast version of the function, which is used when the debugged system is compiled.Macro definitions are represented by lists that are stored on the property list of a symbol.  Macros are often used for functions that should be compiled differently in different Interlisp implementations, and the exact property name a macro definition is stored under determines whether it should be used in a particular implementation.  The global variable MACROPROPS contains a list of all possible macro property names which should be saved by the MACROS file package command.  Typical macro property names are DMACRO for Interlisp-D, 10MACRO for Interlisp-10, VAXMACRO for Interlisp-VAX, JMACRO for Interlisp-Jerico, and MACRO for ªimplementation independentº macros.  The global variable COMPILERMACROPROPS is a list of macro property names.  Interlisp determines whether a symbol has a macro definition by checking these property names, in order, and using the first non-NIL property value as the macro definition.  In Interlisp-D this list contains DMACRO and MACRO in that order so that DMACROs will override the implementation-independent MACRO properties.  In general, use a DMACRO property for macros that are to be used only in Interlisp-D, use 10MACRO for macros that are to be used only in Interlisp-10, and use MACRO for macros that are to affect both systems.Macro definitions can take the following forms:	(LAMBDA ...)		(NLAMBDA ...)	A function can be made to compile open by giving it a macro definition of the form (LAMBDA ...) or (NLAMBDA ...), e.g., (LAMBDA (X) (COND ((GREATERP X 0) X) (T (MINUS X)))) for ABS.  The effect is as if the macro definition were written in place of the function wherever it appears in a function being compiled, i.e., it compiles as a lambda or nlambda expression.  This saves the time necessary to call the function at the price of more compiled code generated in-line.	(NIL EXPRESSION)		(LIST EXPRESSION)	ªSubstitutionº macro.  Each argument in the form being evaluated or compiled is substituted for the corresponding atom in LIST, and the result of the substitution is used instead of the form.  For example, if the macro definition of ADD1 is ((X) (IPLUS X 1)), then, (ADD1 (CAR Y)) is compiled as (IPLUS (CAR Y) 1).		Note that ABS could be defined by the substitution macro ((X) (COND ((GREATERP X 0) X) (T (MINUS X)))).  In this case, however, (ABS (FOO X)) would compile as		(COND ((GREATERP (FOO X) 0)		 		 (FOO X))		 (T (MINUS (FOO X))))		and (FOO X) would be evaluated two times.  (Code to evaluate (FOO X) would be generated three times.)	(OPENLAMBDA ARGS BODY)	This is a cross between substitution and LAMBDA macros.  When the compiler processes an OPENLAMBDA, it attempts to substitute the actual arguments for the formals wherever this preserves the frequency and order of evaluation that would have resulted from a LAMBDA expression, and produces a LAMBDA binding only for those that require it.		Note:  OPENLAMBDA assumes that it can substitute literally the actual arguments for the formal arguments in the body of the macro if the actual is side-effect free or a constant. Thus, you should be careful to use names in ARGS which don't occur in BODY (except as variable references).  For example, if FOO has a macro definition of		(OPENLAMBDA (ENV) (FETCH (MY-RECORD-TYPE ENV) OF BAR))		then (FOO NIL) will expand to		(FETCH (MY-RECORD-TYPE NIL) OF BAR)	T	When a macro definition is the atom T, it means that the compiler should ignore the macro, and compile the function definition; this is a simple way of turning off other macros.  For example, the user may have a function that runs in both Interlisp-D and Interlisp-10, but has a macro definition that should only be used when compiling in Interlisp-10.  If the MACRO property has the macro specification, a DMACRO of T will cause it to be ignored by the Interlisp-D compiler.  This DMACRO would not be necessary if the macro were specified by a 10MACRO instead of a MACRO.	(= . OTHER-FUNCTION)	A simple way to tell the compiler to compile one function exactly as it would compile another.  For example, when compiling in Interlisp-D, FRPLACAs are treated as RPLACAs.  This is achieved by having FRPLACA have a DMACRO of (= . RPLACA).	(LITATOM EXPRESSION)	If a macro definition begins with a symbol other than those given above, this allows computation of the Interlisp expression to be evaluated or compiled in place of the form.  LITATOM is bound to the CDR of the calling form, EXPRESSION is evaluated, and the result of this evaluation is evaluated or compiled in place of the form.  For example, LIST could be compiled using the computed macro:		[X (LIST 'CONS (CAR X)(AND (CDR X)(CONS 'LIST (CDR X]		This would cause (LIST X Y Z) to compile as (CONS X (CONS Y (CONS Z NIL))).  Note the recursion in the macro expansion.		If the result of the evaluation is the symbol IGNOREMACRO, the macro is ignored and the compilation of the expression proceeds as if there were no macro definition.  If the symbol in question is normally treated specially by the compiler (CAR, CDR, COND, AND, etc.), and also has a macro, if the macro expansion returns IGNOREMACRO, the symbol will still be treated specially.		In Interlisp-10, if the result of the evaluation is the atom INSTRUCTIONS, no code will be generated by the compiler.  It is then assumed the evaluation was done for effect and the necessary code, if any, has been added.  This is a way of giving direct instructions to the compiler if you understanÿÿ  d   i t . ÿ 		ÿÿ  I t   i s   o f t e n   u s e f u l ,   w h e n   c o n s t r u c t i n g   c o m p l e x   m a c r o   e x p r e s s i o n s ,   t o   u s e   t h e   B Q U O T E   f a c i l i t y   ( s e e  ÿ the Read Macros section of Chapter 25ÿÿ  ) . ÿ 		ÿÿ  T h e   f o l l o w i n g   f u n c t i o n   i s   q u i t e   u s e f u l   f o r   d e b u g g i n g   m a c r o   d e f i n i t i o n s :  ( E X P A N D M A C R O(EXPANDMACRO (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 18)ÿÿ    E X P   Q U I E T F L G  ï%  ï% )     	 [ F u n c t i o n ]ÿ Takes a form whose CAR has a macro definition and expands the form as it would be compiled.

Use CL:MACROEXPAND-1 to expand Interlisp macros visible to the Common Lisp interpreter and compliler.DEFMACROMacros defined with the function DEFMACRO are much like ªcomputedº macros (see the above section), in that they are defined with a form that is evaluated, and the result of the evaluation is used (evaluated or compiled) in place of the macro call.  However, DEFMACRO macros support complex argument lists with optional arguments, default values, and keyword arguments as well as argument list destructuring.(DEFMACRO(DEFMACRO (Function) NIL NIL ("10") 18) NAME ARGS FORM)  	[NLambda NoSpread Function]Defines NAME as a macro with the arguments ARGS and the definition form FORM (NAME, ARGS, and FORM are unevaluated).  If an expression starting with NAME is evaluated or compiled, arguments are bound according to ARGS, FORM is evaluated, and the value of FORM is evaluated or compiled instead.  The interpretation of ARGS is described below.Note:	Like the function DEFMACRO in Common Lisp, this function currently removes any function definition for NAME.ARGS is a list that defines how the argument list passed to the macro NAME is interpreted.  Specifically, ARGS defines a set of variables that are set to various arguments in the macro call (unevaluated), that FORM can reference to construct the macro form.In the simplest case, ARGS is a simple list of variable names that are set to the corresponding elements of the macro call (unevaluated).  For example, given:(DEFMACRO FOO (A B) (LIST 'PLUS A B B))The macro call (FOO X (BAR Y Z)) will expand to (PLUS X (BAR Y Z) (BAR Y Z)).ª&-keywordsº (beginning with the character ª&º) that are used to set variables to particular items from the macro call form, as follows:	&OPTIONAL	Used to define optional arguments, possibly with default values.  Each element on ARGS after &OPTIONAL until the next &-keyword or the end of the list defines an optional argument, which can either be a symbol or a list, interpreted as follows:		VAR		If an optional argument is specified as a symbol, that variable is set to the corresponding element of the macro call (unevaluated).		(VAR DEFAULT)		If an optional argument is specified as a two element list, VAR is the variable to be set, and DEFAULT is a form that is evaluated and used as the default if there is no corresponding element in the macro call.		(VAR DEFAULT VARSETP)		If an optional argument is specified as a three element list, VAR and DEFAULT are the variable to be set and the default form, and VARSETP is a variable that is set to T if the optional argument is given in the macro call, NIL otherwise.  This can be used to determine whether the argument was not given, or whether it was specified with the default value.		For example, after (DEFMACRO FOO (&OPTIONAL A (B 5) (C 6 CSET)) FORM) expanding the macro call (FOO) would cause FORM to be evaluated with A set to NIL, B set to 5, C set to 6, and CSET set to NIL.  (FOO 4 5 6) would be the same, except that A would be set to 4 and CSET would be set to T.	&REST		&BODY	Used to get a list of all additional arguments from the macro call.  Either &REST or &BODY should be followed by a single symbol, which is set to a list of all arguments to the macro after the position of the &-keyword.  For example, given		(DEFMACRO FOO (A B &REST C) FORM)		expanding the macro call (FOO 1 2 3 4 5) would cause FORM to be evaluated with A set to 1, B set to 2, and C set to (3 4 5).		If the macro calling form contains keyword arguments (see &KEY below), these are included in the &REST list. 	&KEY	Used to define keyword arguments, that are specified in the macro call by including a ªkeywordº (a symbol starting with the character ª:º) followed by a value.		Each element on ARGS after &KEY until the next &-keyword or the end of the list defines a keyword argument, which can either be a symbol or a list, interpreted as follows:		VAR		(VAR)		((KEYWORD VAR))		If a keyword argument is specified by a single symbol VAR, or a one-element list containing VAR, it is set to the value of a keyword argument, where the keyword used is created by adding the character ª:º to the front of VAR.  If a keyword argument is specified by a single-element list containing a two-element list, KEYWORD is interpreted as the keyword (which should start with the letter ª:º), and VAR is the variable to set.		(VAR DEFAULT)		((KEYWORD VAR) DEFAULT)		(VAR DEFAULT VARSETP)		((KEYWORD VAR) DEFAULT VARSETP)		If a keyword argument is specified by a two- or three-element list, the first element of the list specifies the keyword and variable to set as above.  Similar to &OPTIONAL (above), the second element DEFAULT is a form that is evaluated and used as the default if there is no corresponding element in the macro call, and the third element VARSETP is a variable that is set to T if the optional argument is given in the macro call, NIL otherwise.		For example, the form		(DEFMACRO FOO (&KEY A (B 5 BSET) ((:BAR C) 6 CSET)) FORM)		Defines a macro with keys :A, :B (defaulting to 5), and :BAR.  Expanding the macro call (FOO :BAR 2 :A 1) would cause FORM to be evaluated with A set to 1, B set to 5, BSET set to NIL, C set to 2, and CSET set to T.	&ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS	It is an error for any keywords to be supplied in a macro call that are not defined as keywords in the macro argument list, unless either the &-keyword &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS appears in ARGS, or the keyword :ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS (with a non-NIL value) appears in the macro call.	&AUX	Used to bind and initialize auxiliary varables, using a syntax similar to PROG (see the PROG and Associated Control Functions section of Chapter 9).  Any elements after &AUX should be either symbols or lists, interpreted as follows:		VAR		Single symbols are interpreted as auxiliary variables that are initially bound to NIL.		(VAR EXP)		If an auxiliary variable is specified as a two element list, VAR is a variable initially bound to the result of evaluating the form EXP.		For example, given		(DEFMACRO FOO (A B &AUX C (D 5)) FORM)		C will be bound to NIL and D to 5 when FORM is evaluated.	&WHOLE	Used to get the whole macro calling form.  Should be the first element of ARGS, and should be followed by a single symbol, which is set to the entire macro calling form.  Other &-keywords or arguments can follow.  For example, given		(DEFMACRO FOO (&WHOLE X A B) FORM)		Expanding the macro call (FOO 1 2) would cause FORM to be evaluated with X set to (FOO 1 2), A set to 1, and B set to 2.		DEFMACRO macros also support argument list ªdestructuring,º a facility for accessing the structure of individual arguments to a macro.  Any place in an argument list where a symbol is expected, an argument list (in the form described above) can appear instead.  Such an embedded argument list is used to match the corresponding parts of that particular argument, which should be a list structure in the same form.  In the simplest case, where the embedded argument list does not include &-keywords, this provides a simple way of picking apart list structures passed as arguments to a macro.  For example, given		(DEFMACRO FOO (A (B (C . D)) E) FORM)		Expanding the macro call (FOO 1 (2 (3 4 5)) 6) would cause FORM to be evaluated with with A set to 1, B set to 2, C set to 3, D set to (4 5), and E set to 6.  Note that the embedded argument list (B (C . D)) has an embedded argument list (C . D).  Also notice that if an argument list ends in a dotted pair, that the final symbol matches the rest of the arguments in the macro call.		An embedded argument list can also include &-keywords, for interpreting parts of embedded list structures as if they appeared in a top-level macro call.  For example, given		(DEFMACRO FOO (A (B &OPTIONAL (C 6)) D) FORM)		Expanding the macro call (FOO 1 (2) 3) would cause FORM to be evaluated with with A set to 1, B set to 2, C set to 6 (because of the default value), and D set to 3.		Warning: Embedded argument lists can only appear in positions in an argument list where a list is otherwise not accepted.  In the above example, it would not be possible to specify an embedded argument list after the &OPTIONAL keyword, because it would be interpreted as an optional argument specification (with variable name, default value, set variable).  However, it would be possible to specify an embedded argument list as the first element of an optional argument specification list, as so:		(DEFMACRO FOO (A (B &OPTIONAL ((X (Y) Z)			'(1 (2) 3))) D) FORM)		In this case, X, Y, and Z default to 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  Note that the ªdefaultº value has to be an appropriate list structure.  Also, in this case either the whole structure (X (Y) Z) can be supplied, or it can be defaulted (i.e., is not possible to specify X while letting Y default).Interpreting MacrosWhen the interpreter encounters a form CAR of which is an undefined function, it tries interpreting it as a macro.  If CAR of the form has a macro definition, the macro is expanded, and the result of this expansion is evaluated in place of the original form.  CLISPTRAN (see the Miscellaneous Functions and Variables section of Chapter 21) is used to save the result of this expansion so that the expansion only has to be done once.  On subsequent occasions, the translation (expansion) is retrieved from CLISPARRAY the same as for other CLISP constructs.Note:  Because of the way that the evaluator processes macros, if you have a macro on FOO, then typing (FOO 'A 'B) will work, but FOO(A B) will not work.[This page intentionally left blank]     (LIST ((PAGE NIL (PAPERSIZE Letter FOLIOINFO (ARABIC "10-" "")) (0 0 612 792) ((FOLIO NIL (PARALOOKS (QUAD RIGHT) CHARLOOKS (SUPERSCRIPT 0 INVISIBLE OFF SELECTPOINT OFF PROTECTED OFF SIZE 9 FAMILY TIMESROMAN OVERLINE OFF STRIKEOUT OFF UNDERLINE OFF EXPANSION REGULAR SLOPE REGULAR WEIGHT MEDIUM INVERTED OFF USERINFO NIL STYLE NIL) FORMATINFO (ARABIC "10-" "")) (222 24 288 36) NIL) (TEXT NIL NIL (54 36 408 540) NIL))) (PAGE NIL (PAPERSIZE Letter FOLIOINFO (ARABIC "10-" "")) (0 0 612 792) ((FOLIO NIL (PARALOOKS (QUAD LEFT) CHARLOOKS (SUPERSCRIPT 0 INVISIBLE OFF SELECTPOINT OFF PROTECTED OFF SIZE 9 FAMILY TIMESROMAN OVERLINE OFF STRIKEOUT OFF UNDERLINE OFF EXPANSION REGULAR SLOPE REGULAR WEIGHT MEDIUM INVERTED OFF USERINFO NIL STYLE NIL) FORMATINFO (ARABIC "10-" "")) (102 24 288 36) NIL) (HEADING NIL (HEADINGTYPE LEFTBACK) (102 612 510 36) NIL) (TEXT NIL NIL (102 36 456 540) NIL))) (PAGE NIL (PAPERSIZE Letter FOLIOINFO (ARABIC "10-" "")) (0 0 612 792) ((FOLIO NIL (PARALOOKS (QUAD RIGHT) CHARLOOKS (SUPERSCRIPT 0 INVISIBLE OFF SELECTPOINT OFF PROTECTED OFF SIZE 9 FAMILY TIMESROMAN OVERLINE OFF STRIKEOUT OFF UNDERLINE OFF EXPANSION REGULAR SLOPE REGULAR WEIGHT MEDIUM INVERTED OFF USERINFO NIL STYLE NIL) FORMATINFO (ARABIC "10-" "")) (222 24 288 36) NIL) (HEADING NIL (HEADINGTYPE RIGHTPAGE) (48 612 564 36) NIL) (TEXT NIL NIL (54 36 408 540) NIL)))))      ( 5          ~                               5   °                                      / H H°                                     3 0 6°      °                   T         ,  °                                   - l ~°                        T         0 < N°                          T         0 < <°                          T         5   °                                      5   °                                      5   °                                       5   °                                      5   °                                     , H H°                                  ,  °                                  , x x°                                   , Z l°                                  , l ~°                                   , ~ ~°                                   , l ~°                                  / < N°                                    / N N°                                     / < <°                                    1    °     äì   EVEN         T           -    °                     T             @    È             PAGEHEADING 	RIGHTPAGE                   0  È 
