# medley/greetfiles

This directory is somewhat vestigal -- it originally was used to hold 'initialization' files for everyone. Medley repo has only two:

NOGREET   -- file to set as "system init" when doing loadups that don't want any personalization.

SIMPLE-INIT -- system init for git-directory relative directory structure.
      Contains INTERLISPMODE.
