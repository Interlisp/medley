ARCLEANUP Package --- Michael Sannella (and augmented by Susana Wessling, 26-mar-87)The file {eris}<lispcore>internal>library>ARCLEANUP.LCOM contains a few functions used to update the AR database and to print summaries.(AR.CLEANUP UPDATE.FLG INDEX.LOCAL.DIR SUMMARY.FLG SUMMARY.LOCAL.DIR ]This is the main function, which should be run every few days, preferably just as you go out the door (so your machine can crunch on it overnight).  If UPDATE.FLG is non-NIL, all of the ARs that have been touched since the last update are scanned, and the AR database is updated.  If SUMMARY.FLG is non-NIL, a set of summaries is generated on {eris}<lispars>summaries> and press-fied.INDEX.LOCAL.DIR and SUMMARY.LOCAL.DIR are used if you want the AR index and/or the summary reports to be cached on a local disk.  This speeds up the prosess considerably, along with reducing ethernet load.  If non-NIL, each of these should be a host/directory pair, which will be PACKed on the front of a filename to generate the caching filename.  These are not just flags, with caching defaulting to {DSK}, so that I can use multiple partitions for caching.  The issue is space:  Sometimes the local disk does not have enough room for two copies of the AR index, or for both the txt and press version of the grang summary.Example: AR.CLEANUP (T NIL T NIL)-- does cleanup with no cachingAR.CLEANUP (T {DSK} T {DSK2})--- caches index on {DSK}, and the summaries on {DSK2}AR.CLEANUP (T {DSK})--- just does index update, caching on {DSK}.Another useful function:AR.CLEANUP.REDO.SUMMARIES:  just generates summaries, does not do a new cleanup.
