                     CONDITIONGRAPH


Currently in internal rather than lispusers, this package shows a graph of "conditions" (Common Lisp error system).

(FILESLOAD CONDITIONGRAPH) to load it.

(GRAPH-CONDITIONS) will display a graph of conditions and their inheritance.

Other possible operations might be determinable by reading the source.
