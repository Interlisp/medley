<h1>NAME</h1>
<p><strong>loadup</strong> — runs a loadup procedure for Medley
Interlisp</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>&lt;MEDLEYDIR&gt;/scripts/loadup</strong> [ options ... ]</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Runs all or part of the <strong>loadup</strong> procedure for Medley
Interlisp. The loadup procedure is used to create the standard sysout
files from which you can start a Medley session as well as other
standard files that are useful in running Medley. After cloning Medley
from GitHub or after making significant changes to the Medley source,
you need to run the loadup procedure to (re)create these standard
files.</p>
<p>The complete loadup procedure happens in 5 sequential stages with
each stage depending on successful completion of the previous stage.
There are two other non-sequential stages (Aux and DB), which depend
only on the completion of Stage 4 (full.sysout).</p>
<p>You need not run all 5 stages, depending on what sysout files you
need to create for your work. The target files created in each stage are
copied into a loadups directory (&lt;MEDLEYDIR&gt;/loadups). The
<em>medley</em> run script and other Medley tools look for these files
in the loadups directory.</p>
<p>The 5 sequential stages and their main products are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Init:</strong> create an <em>init.dlinit</em> sysout
file. This init.dlinit file is used internally for Stage 2 and is not
copied into the loadups directory.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Mid:</strong> create an <em>init-mid.sysout</em>. This
init-mid.sysout is used only internally for Stage 3 and is not copied
into the loadups directory.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Lisp:</strong> create <em>lisp.sysout</em>. Lisp.sysout
has a minimal set of Medley’s functionality loaded and can be used as
the basis for running a stripped-down Medley session. Lisp.sysout is
copied into the loadups directory.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Full:</strong> create <em>full.sysout</em>. Full.sysout
has all of the “standard” set of Medley functionality loaded and is the
primary sysout used for running Medley sessions. Full.sysout is copied
into the loadups directory.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Apps:</strong>: create <em>apps.sysout</em>. Apps.sysout
includes everything in full.sysout plus the Medley applications Buttons,
CLOS, Rooms, and Notecards.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The two independent stages that can be run if the first 4 sequential
stages complete successfully are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Aux:</strong>: create the <em>whereis.hash</em> and
<em>exports.all</em> files. These are databases that are commonly used
when working on Medley source code. They are copied into the loadups
directory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DB:</strong>: creates the <em>fuller.database</em> file.
Fuller.database is a Mastercope database created by analyzing all of the
source code included in full.sysout. (Stage 4) Fuller.database is copied
into the loadups directory.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Loadup does all of its work in a work directory
(&lt;MEDLEYDIR&gt;loadups/build). The target files are copied from this
work directory to the loadups directory if the loadup is successful.
Each stage of the loadup also creates a dribble file containing the
terminal output from within the Medley environment. These dribble files
are not copied to the loadups directory, but remain available in the
work directory after the loadup completes.</p>
<p>Only one instance (per &lt;MEDLEIDIR&gt;) of loadup can be run at a
time. (The lock file is in the work directory and is named
<strong><em>lock</em></strong>. It can be removed in case of an
uncontrolled failure of the loadup procedure.)</p>
<p>Note: <strong>MEDLEYDIR</strong> is an environment variable set by
the loadup script. It is set to the top level directory of the Medley
installation that contains the specific loadup script that is invoked
after all symbolic links are resolved. In the standard global
installation this will be /usr/local/interlisp/medley. But Medley can be
installed in multiple places on any given machine and hence MEDLEYDIR is
computed on each invocation of loadup.</p>
<h1>OPTIONS</h1>
<dl>
<dt><strong>-z, --man, -man</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Print this manual page on the screen.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-t STAGE, --target STAGE, -target STAGE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Run the sequential loadup procedure until the STAGE is complete,
starting from the files created by the previously run STAGE specified in
the –start option.</p>
<p>STAGE can be one of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i, init, 1: Run the loadup sequence through Stage 1 (init.dlinit).
Init.dlinit is <em>not</em> copied into the loadups directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>m, mid, 2: Run the loadup sequence through Stage 2 (init-mid.sysout).
Init-mid.sysout is <em>not</em> copied into the loadups directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>l, lisp, 3: Run the loadup sequence through Stage 3 (lisp.sysout).
Lisp.sysout is copied into the loadups directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>f, full, 4: Run the loadup sequence through Stage 4 (full.sysout).
Full.sysout is copied into the loadups directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a, apps, 5: Run the loadup sequence through Stage 5 (apps.sysout).
Apps.sysout is copied into the loadups directory.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-s STAGE --start STAGE, -start STAGE</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Start the loadup process using the files previously created by STAGE.
These files are looked for first in the loadups directory or, if not
found there, in the work directory. It is an error if the files created
by STAGE cannot be found.</p>
<p>STAGE can be one of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>s, scratch, 0 : Start the loadup process from the beginning. This is
the default.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>i, init, 1 : Start the loadup process using the files created by
Stage 1 (init.dlinit).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>m, mid, 2 : Start the loadup process using the files created by Stage
2 (init-mid.sysout).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>l, lisp, 3 : Start the loadup process using the files created by
Stage 3 (lisp.sysout)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>f, full, 4 : Start the loadup process using the files created by
Stage 4 (full.sysout).</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-x, --aux, -aux</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Run the Aux loadup stage, creating the <em>whereis.hash</em> and
<em>exports.all</em> files. If loadup completes successfully, these
files are copied into loadups.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-b, --db, -db</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Run the DB loadup stage, creating the <em>fuller.database</em> file.
If this stage complete successfully, these files are copied into
loadups.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-i, --init, -init, -1</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Synonym for “–target init”</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-m, --mid, -mid, -2</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Synonym for “–target mid”</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-l, --lisp, -lisp, -3</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Synonym for “–target lisp”</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-f, --full. -full, -4</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Synonym for “–target full”</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-a, --apps, -apps, -5</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Synonym for “–target apps”</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-nc, --nocopy, -nocopy</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Run the specified loadups, but do not copy results into loadups
directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-tw, --thinw, -thinw</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Before running loadups (if any), thin the working directory by
deleting all versioned (<em>.~[0-9]</em>~) files.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-tl, --thinl, -thinl</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Before running loadups (if any), thin the loadups directory by
deleting all versioned (<em>.~[0-9]</em>~) files.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>-d DIR --maikodir DIR, -maikodir DIR</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>Use DIR as the directory from which to execute lde (Miko) when
running Medley in the loadup process. If this flag is not present, the
value of the environment variable MAIKODIR will be used instead. And if
MAIKODIR does not exist, then the default Maiko directory search within
Medley will be used.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h1>DEFAULTS</h1>
<p>The defaults for the Options context-dependent and somewhat
complicated due to the goal of maintaining compatibility with legacy
loadup scripts. All of the following defaults rules hold independent of
the –maikodir (-d) option.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If none of –target, –start, –aux, and –db are specified,
then:</p>
<p>1A. If neither –thinw nor –thinl are specified, the options default
to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>–target full –start 0 –aux</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>1B. If either –thinw or –thinl are specified, no loadups are
run.</p></li>
<li><p>If neither –start nor –target are specified but either -aux or
-db or both are, then –start defaults to <em>full</em> and –target is
irrelevant.</p></li>
<li><p>If –start is specified and –target is not, then –target defaults
to <em>full</em></p></li>
<li><p>If –target is specified and –start is not, then –start defaults
to <em>0</em></p></li>
</ol>
<h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p><strong>./loadup -full -s lisp</strong> : run loadup thru Stage 4
(full.sysout) starting from existing Stage 3 outputs (lisp.sysout).</p>
<p><strong>./loadup --target full --start lisp</strong> : run loadup
thru Stage 4 (full.sysout) starting from existing Stage 3 outputs
(lisp.sysout).</p>
<p><strong>loadup -5 –aux</strong> : run loadup from the beginning thru
Stage 5 (apps.sysout) then run the Aux “stage” to create
<em>whereis.hash</em> and <em>exports.all</em></p>
<p><strong>loadup -db</strong> : just run the DB “stage” starting from
an existing full.sysout; do not run any of the sequential stages.</p>
<p><strong>loadup –maikodir ~/il/newmaiko</strong> : run loadup sequence
from beginning to full plus the loadup Aux stage, while using
<em>~/il/newmaiko</em> as the location for the lde executables when
running Medley.</p>
<p><strong>loadup -full</strong> : run loadup sequence from beginning
thru full. (Do not run the Aux stage unlike in the case of the legacy
loadup-full.sh)</p>
