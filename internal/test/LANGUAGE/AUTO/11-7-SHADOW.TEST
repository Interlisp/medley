If such a symbol is directly present in the package, then nothing is done.;; Otherwise, a new symbol is created with the print name, and it is inserted in the;; package as an internal symbol.  The symbol is also placed on the shadowing symbols;; list of the package.    ;;   ;; ;; Argument(s):  symbol(s) package (optional);;			  ;; Returns: T     ;;;; Constraints/Limitations: none(do-test "unintern"	(and (setq barr1 (make-package "BAZ1"))		(member (find-package 'LISP) (package-use-list barr1))		(setq blap1 (make-package "FRUMBLE1" :use NIL))		(use-package blap1 barr1)		(set (intern "HURM1" blap1) 52)		(shadow 'HURM1 barr1)		(not (boundp (intern "HURM1" barr1)))	))		STOP
