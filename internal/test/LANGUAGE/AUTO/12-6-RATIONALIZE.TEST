If the argument is already rational, it is returned.;; The two functions differ in their treatment of floating-point numbers.;; ;; RATIONAL assumes that the floating-point number is completely accurate;; and returns a rational number mathematically equal to the precise;; value of the floating-point number.;; ;; RATIONALIZE assumes that the;; floating-point number is accurate only to the precision of the;; floating-point representation, and may return any rational number for;; which the floating-point number is the best available approximation of;; its format; in doing this it attempts to keep both numerator and;; denominator small.;; ;; It is always the case that;; ;;     (FLOAT (RATIONAL X) X) = X;;     ;; and;; ;;     (FLOAT (RATIONALIZE X) X) = X;;     ;; That is, rationalizing a floating-point number by either method;; and then converting it back;; to a floating-point number of the same format produces the original number.;; What distinguishes the two functions is that RATIONAL typically;; has a simple, inexpensive implementation, whereas RATIONALIZE goes;; to more trouble to produce a result that is more pleasant to view and;; simpler for some purposes to compute with.;; ;; Argument(s):   NUMBER - a number;;;; Returns:       a number;;(do-test rationalize-test  (and (eql (rationalize 10) 10)       (eql (rationalize 3.1) (/ 31 10))       (rationalp (rationalize 3.1))       (eql (float (rationalize 3.1)) 3.1)       (eql (rationalize (/ 10 5)) 2)       (rationalp (rationalize (/ 10 5)))       (eql (rationalize 3E3) 3000)))STOP
