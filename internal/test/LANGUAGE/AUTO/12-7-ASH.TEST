;; Function To Be Tested: ash;;;; Source:     Common Lisp by Guy Steele;;         Section 12.7: Logical Operations on Numbers  Page: 224;;;; Created By: John Park;;;; Creation Date: July 15, 86;;;; Last Update:   ;;;; Filed as:      {eris}<lispcore>cml>test>12-7-ash.test;;;; Syntax: ash integer count ;;;; Function Description:;; This function shifts INTEGER arithmetically left by COUNT bit;; positions if COUNT is positive,;; or right -COUNT bit positions if COUNT is negative.;; The sign of the result is always the same as the sign of INTEGER.;; ;; Mathematically speaking, this operation performs the computation;; FLOOR(INTEGER*2^count).;; ;; Logically, this moves all of the bits in INTEGER to the left,;; adding zero-bits at the bottom, or moves them to the right,;; discarding bits.  (In this context the question of what gets shifted;; in on the left is irrelevant; integers, viewed as strings of bits,;; are ``half-infinite,'' that is, conceptually extend infinitely far to the left.);; For example:;; ;;     (LOGBITP J (ASH N K));;        = (AND (>= J K) (LOGBITP (- J K) N));;     ;; ;; Argument(s):   INTEGER - an integer;;                COUNT - an integer;;;; Returns:       a number;;	(do-test ash-test			(and	(eq (ash 1 1) 2)				(eq (ash 1 2) 4)				(eq (ash 1 3) 8)				(eq (ash 1 4) 16)				(eq (ash 1 10) 1024)				(eq (ash 1 0) 1)				(eq (ash 1 -1) 0)				(eq (ash 15 -1) 7)				(eq (ash 15 -2) 3)				(eq (ash 15 -3) 1)				(eq (ash -1 1) -2)				(eq (ash -1 3) -8)				(eq (ash -1 -1) -1)))						STOP
