;; Function To Be Tested: INTEGER-LENGTH;;;; Source: Guy L Steele's CLTL;; Section: 12.7 Logical Operations on Numbers;; Page: 224;;;; Created By:    Kelly Roach;;;; Creation Date: July 12,1986;;;; Last Update:   July 12,1986;;;; Filed As:      {ERIS}<LISPCORE>CML>TEST>12-7-INTEGER-LENGTH.TEST;;;;;; Syntax:        (INTEGER-LENGTH INTEGER);;;; Function Description:;; This function performs the computation;; ;; ;; CEILING(log2(if INTEGER < 0 then -INTEGER else INTEGER+1));; ;; This is useful in two different ways.;; First, if INTEGER is non-negative, then its value can be represented;; in unsigned binary form in a field whose width in bits is;; no smaller than (INTEGER-LENGTH INTEGER).;; Second, regardless of the sign of INTEGER, its value can be;; represented in signed binary two's-complement form in a field;; whose width in bits is no smaller than (+ (INTEGER-LENGTH INTEGER) 1).;; For example:;; ;;     (INTEGER-LENGTH 0) => 0;;     (INTEGER-LENGTH 1) => 1;;     (INTEGER-LENGTH 3) => 2;;     (INTEGER-LENGTH 4) => 3;;     (INTEGER-LENGTH 7) => 3;;     (INTEGER-LENGTH -1) => 0;;     (INTEGER-LENGTH -4) => 2;;     (INTEGER-LENGTH -7) => 3;;     (INTEGER-LENGTH -8) => 3;;     ;; Compatibility note: This function is similar to the Maclisp;; function HAULONG.  One may define HAULONG as;; ;;     (HAULONG X) = (INTEGER-LENGTH (ABS X));;     ;; ;; ;; Argument(s):   INTEGER - an integer;;;; Returns:       a number;;(do-test integer-length-test         (and (eq (integer-length 0) 0)              (eq (integer-length 1) 1)              (eq (integer-length 3) 2)              (eq (integer-length 4) 3)              (eq (integer-length 7) 3)              (eq (integer-length -1) 0)              (eq (integer-length -4) 2)              (eq (integer-length -7) 3)              (eq (integer-length -8) 3)))STOP
