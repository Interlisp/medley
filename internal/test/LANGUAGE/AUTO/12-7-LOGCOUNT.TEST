;; Function To Be Tested: LOGCOUNT;;;; Source: Guy L Steele's CLTL;; Section: 12.7 Logical Operations on Numbers;; Page: 224;;;; Created By:    Kelly Roach;;;; Creation Date: July 12,1986;;;; Last Update:   July 12,1986;;;; Filed As:      {ERIS}<LISPCORE>CML>TEST>12-7-LOGCOUNT.TEST;;;;;; Syntax:        (LOGCOUNT INTEGER);;;; Function Description:;; The number of bits in INTEGER is determined and returned.;; If INTEGER is positive, then 1 bits in its binary;; representation are counted.  If INTEGER is negative, then;; the 0 bits in its two's-complement binary representation are counted.;; The result is always a non-negative integer.;; For example:;; ;;     ;;     (LOGCOUNT 13) => 3         ;Binary representation is ...0001101;;     (LOGCOUNT -13) => 2         ;Binary representation is ...1110011;;     (LOGCOUNT 30) => 4         ;Binary representation is ...0011110;;     (LOGCOUNT -30) => 4         ;Binary representation is ...1100010;;     ;; The following identity always holds:;; ;;     (LOGCOUNT X) = (LOGCOUNT (- (+ X 1)));;                  = (LOGCOUNT (LOGNOT X));;     ;; ;; Argument(s):   INTEGER - an integer;;;; Returns:       a number;;(do-test logcount-test         (and (eq (logcount 1) 1)              (eq (logcount 10) 2)              (eq (logcount 15) 4)              (eq (logcount -1) 0)              (eq (logcount -30) 4)))STOP
