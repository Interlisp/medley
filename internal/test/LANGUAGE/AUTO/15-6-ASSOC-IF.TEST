;; Function To Be Tested: ASSOC-IF;;;; Source: Guy L Steele's CLTL;; Section: 15.6 Association Lists;; Page: 280;;;; Created By:    Kelly Roach;;;; Creation Date: June 27,1986;;;; Last Update:   June 27,1986;;;; Filed As:      {ERIS}<LISPCORE>CML>TEST>15-6-ASSOC-IF.TEST;;;;;; Syntax:        (ASSOC-IF PREDICATE ALIST);;;; Function Description:;; Each of these searches the association list;; A-LIST.  The value is the first pair in the a-list such that;; the CAR of the pair satisfies the test, or NIL if there is;; no such pair in the a-list.;; For example:;; ;;     (ASSOC 'R '((A . B) (C . D) (R . X) (S . Y) (R . Z)));;     	=>  (R . X);;     (ASSOC 'GOO '((FOO . BAR) (ZOO . GOO))) => NIL;;     (ASSOC '2 '((1 A B C) (2 B C D) (-7 X Y Z))) => (2 B C D);;     ;; It is possible to RPLACD the result of ASSOC PROVIDED;; that it is not NIL,;; in order to ``update'' the ``table'' that was ASSOC's second argument.;; (However, it is often better to update an a-list by adding new pairs;; to the front, rather than altering old pairs.);; For example:;; ;;     (SETQ VALUES '((X . 100) (Y . 200) (Z . 50)));;     (ASSOC 'Y VALUES) => (Y . 200);;;;     (RPLACD (ASSOC 'Y VALUES) 201);;     (ASSOC 'Y VALUES) => (Y . 201) now;;     ;; A typical trick is to say;; (CDR (ASSOC X Y)).;; Because the CDR of NIL is guaranteed to be NIL,;; this yields NIL if no pair is found OR if a pair is;; found whose CDR is NIL.  This is useful if NIL serves;; its usual role as a ``default value.'';; ;; The two expressions;; ;;     (ASSOC ITEM LIST :TEST FN);;     ;; and;; ;;     (FIND ITEM LIST :TEST FN :KEY #'CAR);;     ;; are equivalent in meaning with one important exception:;;;; if NIL appears in the a-list in place of a pair,;; and the ITEM being searched for is NIL,;; FIND will blithely compute the CAR of the NIL in the a-list,;; find that it is equal to the ITEM, and return NIL,;; whereas ASSOC will ignore the NIL in the a-list and continue;; to search for an actual pair (cons) whose CAR is NIL.;; See function FIND and function POSITION.;; ;; Compatibility note: In Maclisp, the ASSOC function uses;; an EQUAL comparison rather than EQL, which is the default;; test for ASSOC in ;; Common Lisp.  Where in Maclisp one would write;; (ASSOC X Y), in Common Lisp one must write (ASSOC X Y :TEST #'EQUAL);; to get the completely identical effect.  Similarly, one can get the;; precise effect, and no more, of the Maclisp (ASSQ X Y);; by writing in Common Lisp (ASSOC X Y :TEST #'EQ).;; ;; In Interlisp, ASSOC uses an EQ test, and SASSOC;; uses an Interlisp EQUAL test.;; ;; Argument(s):   PREDICATE - a function;;                ALIST - an association list;;;; Returns:       a list;;(DO-TEST "ASSOC-IF TEST 1" (EQUAL (ASSOC-IF (QUOTE NUMBERP)                                      (QUOTE ((1 1)                                              (A 2)                                              ("FOO" 3)                                              ((1 2)                                               4)                                              (NIL T))))                               (QUOTE (1 1)))       (EQUAL (ASSOC-IF (QUOTE SYMBOLP)                     (QUOTE ((1 1)                             (A 2)                             ("FOO" 3)                             ((1 2)                              4)                             (NIL T))))              (QUOTE (A 2)))       (EQUAL (ASSOC-IF (QUOTE STRINGP)                     (QUOTE ((1 1)                             (A 2)                             ("FOO" 3)                             ((1 2)                              4)                             (NIL T))))              (QUOTE ("FOO" 3)))       (EQUAL (ASSOC-IF (QUOTE LISTP)                     (QUOTE ((1 1)                             (A 2)                             ("FOO" 3)                             ((1 2)                              4)                             (NIL T))))              (QUOTE ((1 2)                      4)))       (EQUAL (ASSOC-IF (QUOTE NULL)                     (QUOTE ((1 1)                             (A 2)                             ("FOO" 3)                             ((1 2)                              4)                             (NIL T))))              (QUOTE (NIL T))))STOP
