;; Function To Be Tested: RASSOC-IF-NOT;;;; Source: Guy L Steele's CLTL;; Section: 15.6 Association Lists;; Page: 281;;;; Created By:    Kelly Roach;;;; Creation Date: June 27,1986;;;; Last Update:   June 27,1986;;;; Filed As:      {ERIS}<LISPCORE>CML>TEST>15-6-RASSOC-IF-NOT.TEST;;;;;; Syntax:        (RASSOC-IF-NOT PREDICATE ALIST);;;; Function Description:;; RASSOC is the reverse form of ASSOC; it searches for;; a pair whose CDR satisfies the test, rather than the CAR.;; If the A-LIST is considered to be a mapping, then RASSOC;; treats the A-LIST as representing the inverse mapping.;; For example:;; ;;     (RASSOC 'A '((A . B) (B . C) (C . A) (Z . A))) => (C . A);;     ;; ;; The expressions;; ;;     (RASSOC ITEM LIST :TEST FN);;     ;; and;; ;;     (FIND ITEM LIST :TEST FN :KEY #'CDR);;     ;; are equivalent in meaning, except when the ITEM is NIL;; and NIL appears in place of a pair in the a-list.  See the discussion;; of the function function ASSOC.;; ;; Argument(s):   PREDICATE - a function;;                ALIST - an association list;;;; Returns:       a list;;(DO-TEST "RASSOC-IF-NOT TEST 1"       (EQUAL (RASSOC-IF-NOT (QUOTE NUMBERP)                     (QUOTE ((1 . 1)                             (2 .
