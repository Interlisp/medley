Comparison is case-insensitive.;;;; Argument(s):	string1, string2: character strings;;			:start1, start2: the start-comparison position in the respective strings (counting from 0);;			:end1, end2: the last character + 1 (counting from 0) to compare - i.e. if comparing "string" with a :end keyword of 4, the last character compared will be the letter i.				        	;;;; Returns:	If all characters satisfy char/=: the index (counting from 0) of the first non-identical character - i.e. the length of the portion of the strings that satisfies the predicate.;;			If not: nil          ;;(do-test-group string-not-equal-group	:before	(progn		(test-setq longstring "paring string with a :end keyword of 4, the last character compared will be the letter i.				        	;;;; Returns:	If all characters satisfy char-not-equal: the index (counting from 0) of the first non-identical chara";; END LONGSTRING DEFINITION		)	)	(do-test string-not-equal-test		(AND;; Change just one character; the predicate should hold.			(let ((string2 (copy-seq longstring)))				(replace string2 "?" :end 0)				(string-not-equal longstring string2)			);; A string shouldn't be unequal to itself			(not (string-not-equal (string-upcase longstring) (string-downcase longstring)))		)	))STOP
