This includes self-evaluating objects;; such as numbers, characters, strings, bit-vectors, and keywords, as well as;; all constant symbols declared by defconstant, such as nil t and pi.  ;; In addition, a list whose car is quote, such as (quote foo), is considered ;; to be constant.  ;;;; Argument(s): object;;			  ;; Returns: T or NIL    ;;;; Constraints/Limitations:(do-test "constantp-test1"		(and (constantp NIL)			(constantp T)			(constantp pi)			(constantp *evalhook*)			(constantp most-positive-double-float)			(constantp "STRING")			(constantp #\a)			(constantp #*)			(constantp 132984)			(constantp #C(1.0 2.0))			(constantp :INTERNAL)			(constantp (car '((quote foo) (quote bar))))		))STOP
