;; Function To Be Tested: ccase;;;; Source: Guy L Steele's CLTL;; Section: 24.3 ERRORS (Special Forms for Exhaustive Case Analysis);; Page: 436;;;; Created By:   John Park;;;; Creation Date: Nov 7, 1986;;;; Last Update:   Jan 15, 1987;;;; Filed As:      {ERIS}<LISPCORE>CML>TEST>24-3-ccase.test;;;;;; Syntax:        (ccase keyform {({({key}*)|key} {form}*)}*;;;; Function Description: This control construct is similar to case, but no explicit;; otherwise or T clause is permitted.  If no clause is satisfied, ccase signals;; an error with a message constructed from the clauses.  Continuing from this;; error causes ccase to accept a new value from the user, store it into keyplace;; , and start over, making the clause tests again.  Subforms of keyplace may be;; evaluated multiple times.  The name of this function stands from "continuable;; exhaustive case.";;;; Argument(s): Keyplace: Key (variable);;			(type {form}): type case for error checking;;			  ;; Returns:      ;;;; Constraints/Limitations: Due to the nature of ccase function, which enters;; the debugger (break), this test should be conducted manually to see if correct ;; error messages are returned.  Tests requiring user interface are commented out.(do-test "ccase-test0"		(macro-function 'ccase) ; Does ccase have a macro definition?)(do-test "ccase-test1"		(and (setq x 'alpha)			(defun foo () 'foo-for-alpha)			(defun bar () 'bar-for-omega)			(defun baz () 'baz-for-zeta)			(setq alpha 1 omega 2 zeta 3 phi 4)			(equal (mapcar #'(lambda (x) 						   (ccase x				 			(alpha (foo))				 			(omega (bar))				 			((zeta phi) (baz))))						'(alpha omega zeta phi))				  (list (foo) (bar) (baz) (baz)))				)) ; This should not break since each of the three clauses is satisfied.;; The following (ccase-test2) should break with the appropriate error message,;; prompt for a new value, and return when the new value satisfies one of the;; three clauses;; "Error: The value of X, 1/3, is neither an integer nor a symbol";;;;	(progn (setq x 1/3);;		  (ccase x;;			(alpha (foo));;			(omega (bar));;			((zeta phi) (baz)));;	  )STOP
