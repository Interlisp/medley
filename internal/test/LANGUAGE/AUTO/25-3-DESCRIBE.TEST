;; Function To Be Tested:  describe;;;; Source: Guy L Steele's CLTL Chapter 25:Miscellaneous Features;; Section: 25.3  Debugging Tools;; Page: 441;;;; Created By:   John Park;;;; Creation Date: Sep 9, 1986;;;; Last Update:  Dec 23, 1986 ;;;; Filed As: {ERIS}<LISPCORE>CML>TEST>25-3-describe.test;;;;;; Syntax:        (describe object);;;; Function Description: Describe prints, to the stream in the variable;; *standard-output*, information about the object. Sometimes, it will describe ;; something that it finds inside something else; such recursive descriptions are;; indented appropriately.  For instance, describe of a symbol will exhibit the;; symbol's value, its definition, and each of its properties.  Describe of a;; floating-point number will exhibit its internal representation in a way that;; is useful for tracking down round-off errors and the like.  ;;;; Argument(s):  object;;			  ;; Returns: no values or what the expression (values) returns.  ;;;; Constraints/Limitations: Visual inspection of results is required to see if;; the function describe prints sufficient information about the object. This is;; dependent upon each implementation but it should return (values).;; The following is an example of what describe might print:;; (setq array-1 (make-array '(3 4) :initial-element 0));; (describe array-1) => It is a simple-array (brief description);; Dimensions: (3 4) Element Type: t Adjustable: no Displaced: no, etc.(do-test "describe-test-function"	 (flet ((factorial (n)				(lambda (n)(cond ((zerop n) 1)						  	(t (* n (factorial (1- n))))))))			(eq (describe 'factorial) (values))	 ))(do-test "describe-test-string"	(let ((xyz "string"))		(eq (describe xyz) (values))	))(do-test "describe-test-number"	(let ((number-1 10000.88))		(eq (describe number-1) (values))	))(do-test "describe-test-hashtable"	(let ((hashtable (make-hash-table :size 9)))		(eq (describe hashtable) (values))	))(do-test "describe-test-array"	(let ((array-1  (make-array '(3 4) :initial-element 0)))		(eq (describe array-1) (values))	))(do-test "describe-test-structure"	(let ((structure (defstruct line a b c)))			(eq (describe structure) (values))	))(do-test "describe-test-package"	(let ((package-1 			(make-package "abc-package" :nicknames '("NICKNAME-10"))))		(and (eq (describe package-1) (values))			(if (and (fboundp 'delete-package)					(member (find-package "abc-package") 							  (list-all-packages))				)				(progn (delete-package (find-package "abc-package"))					  (identity T)				)			  T)		)	))STOP
