This time is relative to an arbitrary time base, but the difference;; between the values of two calls to this function will be the amount of elapsed;; real time between the two calls measured in the units defined by ;; internal-time-units-per-second. ;;;; Argument(s):  none;;			  ;; Returns: Integer  ;;;; Constraints/Limitations: none(do-test-group ("get-internal-real-time-setup"	:before (progn			(setq before-internal-time (get-internal-real-time))			(defstruct science physics chemistry math)			(setq after-internal-time (get-internal-real-time))))		(do-test "internal-time-units-per-second-exist?"	 (and (integerp internal-time-units-per-second)		 (boundp 'internal-time-units-per-second)))(do-test "get-internal-real-time"	 (and(integerp (get-internal-real-time))		(> (- after-internal-time before-internal-time) 0))))	 							STOP
