In the chapter on sequences;;;; it is explained why this was a bad choice.  Here the name MAP;; is used for the far more useful generic sequence mapper,;; in closer accordance to the computer science literature,;; especially the growing body of papers on functional programming.;; These functions are used when the function is being called merely for its;; side effects, rather than its returned values.;; The value returned by MAPL or MAPC is the second argument,;; that is, the first sequence argument.;; ;; MAPCAN and MAPCON are like MAPCAR and MAPLIST respectively,;; except that they combine the results of;; the function using function NCONC instead of LIST.  That is,;; ;;     (MAPCON F X1 ... XN);;        = (APPLY #'NCONC (MAPLIST F X1 ... XN));;     ;; and similarly for the relationship between MAPCAN and MAPCAR.;; Conceptually, these functions allow the mapped function to return;; a variable number of items to be put into the output list.;; This is particularly useful for effectively returning zero or one item:;; ;;     (MAPCAN #'(LAMBDA (X) (AND (NUMBERP X) (LIST X)));;     	'(A 1 B C 3 4 D 5));; ;;       => (1 3 4 5);;     ;; In this case the function serves as a filter; this is a standard Lisp;; idiom using MAPCAN.;; (The function function REMOVE-IF-NOT might have been useful in this;; particular context, however.);; Remember that NCONC is a destructive operation, and therefore;; so are MAPCAN and MAPCON; the lists returned by the FUNCTION;; are altered in order to concatenate them.;; ;; Sometimes a DO or a straightforward recursion is preferable to a;; mapping operation;  however, the mapping functions should be used wherever they;; naturally apply because this increases the clarity of the code. ;; ;; The functional argument to a mapping function must be acceptable;; to APPLY; it cannot be a macro or the name of a special form.;; Of course, there is nothing wrong with using a function that has ;; and  parameters as the functional argument.;; ;; Argument(s):   FUNCTION - a function;;                LIST - a pure list;;                MORE-LISTS - a pure list;;;; Returns:       a pure list;;(do-test "test maplist1 - test cases from page 129 of CLtL"    (and (equal (maplist #'(lambda (x) (cons 'foo x)) '(a b c d))               '((foo a b c d) (foo b c d) (foo c d) (foo d)))         (equal (maplist #'(lambda (x) (if (member (car x) (cdr x)) 0 1)) '(a b a c d b c))               '(0 0 1 0 1 1 1))))(do-test "test maplist2 - append & first & butlast"    (and (equal (maplist #'append (list 1 2 3 4) (cons 5 (cons 6 (cons 7 (cons 8 nil)))))               '((1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8) (2 3 4 6 7 8) (3 4 7 8) (4 8)))         (equal (maplist #'first '('x 'e 'r 'o 'x )) '('x 'e 'r 'o 'x))         (equal (maplist #'butlast '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8))                '((1 2 3 4 5 6 7) (2 3 4 5 6 7) (3 4 5 6 7) (4 5 6 7) (5 6 7) (6 7) (7) nil))))(do-test "test maplist3 - list-length "    (and (setq long-list (maplist #'list-length (make-list 50)))         (= (apply #'+ long-list) (/ (* 50 51) 2))))(do-test "test maplist4 - lambda function"    (equal (maplist #'(lambda (x y z) (append (reverse x) (reverse y) (reverse z)))                           `(a c e) `(b a k) `(l o p))                  '((e c a k a b p o l) (e c k a p o) (e k p))))(do-test "test maplist5 - tests for different length of lists"    (and (equal (maplist #'(lambda (x y) (+ (list-length x) (list-length y))) '(1 2) '(2 3 4)) '(5 3))         (eq    (maplist #'list `(a b c) nil)  nil)         (equal (maplist #'cons `(a b c) `(d e)) '(((a b c) d e) ((b c) e)))))STOP
