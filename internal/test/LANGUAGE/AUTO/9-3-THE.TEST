It returns the ;;					evaluated value of FORM.  It is an error if what is produced by the form does not conform to ;;					the data type specified by VALUE-TYPE.;;;; Argument(s):           VALUE-TYPE - a lisp type specifier;;					FORM       -;;;; Returns:                any lisp object  ;;(do-test "test the 0"	(and (= (the integer 30) 30)		(= (the float  23.9) 23.9)		(= (the (integer 2 10) 2) 2)		(= (the (mod 100) (1- 1)) 0)		(= (the (mod 1000) (1+ 998)) 999)		(= (the (unsigned-byte 3) 7) 7)		(= (the (unsigned-byte 4) 13) 13)		(= (the (float -99.2 99.2) -99.01) -99.01)		(= (the complex #c(1 -2)) #c(1 -2))		(= (the (complex float) #c(1.1 -9.3)) #c(1.1 -9.3))		(= (the (complex integer) #c(2 10)) #c(2 10))		(= (the (complex ratio) #c(2/3 5/9)) #c(2/3 5/9))		(= (the rational 20) 20)		(= (the (rational 2/13  2/5)  2/7) 2/7)	))(do-test "test the 1"	(and (equal (the string "jkfldjskl") "jkfldjskl")		(equal (the (string 20) (make-string 20 :initial-element #\a)) "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa")		(equalp (the simple-vector (vector 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1)) #*10100011)		(equalp (the (bit-vector 10) #*0000011111) (vector 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1))		(equalp (the array (make-array '(2 2) :initial-contents '((a b) (c d)) )) 					    (make-array '(2 2) :initial-contents '((a b) (c d)) ))		(equalp (the (vector * 5) (vector 1 2 3 4 5))  (vector 1 2 3 4 5))	))(do-test "test the 2"	(and (=     (the (satisfies evenp) 10) 10)		(char= (the (satisfies characterp) #\q) #\q)		(=     (the (member 2 4 6 8 10) 6) 6)		(eq    (the (member abc def ghi) 'def) 'def)		(equal (the (not list) "abc") "abc")		(eq    (the (and symbol list) nil) nil)		(eq    (the (or t nil) (find #\a "bcd")) nil)	))(do-test "test the 3"	(and (equal (multiple-value-list (the (values integer integer float) (values 2 3 1.2))) '(2 3 1.2))		(equal (multiple-value-list (the (values  list string character) (values '(1 2) "12" #\1))) '((1 2) "12" #\1))		(equal (multiple-value-list (the (values bit ratio complex) (values 1 2/9 #C(1 1)))) '(1 2/9 #c(1 1)))	))STOP
