;; Function To Be Tested:  trace;;;; Source: Guy L Steele's CLTL Chapter 25:Miscellaneous Features;; Section: 25.3  Debugging Tools;; Page: 440;;;; Created By:   John Park;;;; Creation Date: Aug 28,1986;;;; Last Update:  Oct 3, 1986 ;;;; Filed As: {ERIS}<LISPCORE>CML>TEST>25-3-trace.test;;;;;; Syntax:        (trace {function-name}*);;;; Function Description: Invoking trace with one or more function names (symbols);; causes the functions named to be traced.  Henceforth, whenever such a function;; is invoked, information about the call, the arguments passed, and the eventually;; returned values, if any, will be printed to the stream that is the value of;; *trace-output*.  Tracing an already traced function, not currently being traced, ;; should produce no harmful effects, but may produce a warning message.  Calling;; trace with no argument forms will return a list of functions currently being;; traced.;;;; Argument(s):  function name(s);;			  ;; Returns: list of function(s) being traced.  ;;;; Constraints/Limitations: This test is divided into two parts: testing xerox;; implementation of trace and other implementations of trace. Since this function;; requires user-interface, it's not realistic  to run this test automatically. ;; For the Xerox implementation, the test is conducted to determine if the functions;; being traced are returned without opening or closing the tracewindow.  On other;; implementations, this merely tests to see if  there is a global function ;; definition for trace, which does not necessarily mean it has met the requirements;; prescribed in CLtL.  For complete certification, manual testing is required.(do-test-group ("trace-test-setup"		:before (progn				(defun factorial (n)					 	(cond ((zerop n) 1)						  	(t (* n (factorial (1- n))))))				(defun fibonacci (n) 						(cond ((= n 0) 1)							 ((= n 1) 1)							 (t (+ (fibonacci (- n 1))								  (fibonacci (- n 2))))))				(defun squash (s)						(cond ((null s) nil)							 ((atom s) (list s))							 (t (append (squash (car s))									  (squash (cdr s))))))				(defun trace-test (implementation-type)					(cond ((string-equal implementation-type "XEROX")							(trace-test-xerox))						 (t (trace-test-others))))								(defun trace-test-xerox () 					(and (boundp 'tracewindow)						(equal (trace factorial) '(factorial))						(untrace)						(equal (trace  fibonacci squash) 								'(fibonacci squash))						(untrace squash)						(equal (trace) '(fibonacci))						(untrace)						(eq (trace) nil)						(untrace)))				(defun trace-test-others ()						(fboundp 'trace))				)			   )					(do-test "trace-test"		(trace-test (lisp-implementation-type))))			STOP
