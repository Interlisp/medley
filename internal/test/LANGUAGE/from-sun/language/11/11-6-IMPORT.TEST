These symbols become internal symbols in package and can;; therefore be referred to without having to use qualified-name (colon) syntax.;; import signals a correctable error if any of the imported symbols has the same;; name as some distinct symbol already accessible in the package.  Import returns T.;; ;; Argument(s):  Symbol(s);;			 Package (optional);;			  ;; Returns:     T;;;; Constraints/Limitations: none(do-test-group (import-group	:before (setq im-foo (make-package "IM-BAR" :use nil))	)	(do-test "import returns T"		(eq (import '(lisp:rational lisp:plusp) 'im-bar) T)	)	(do-test "symbols imported from LISP"		(and			(eq 'lisp:rational (find-symbol "RATIONAL" 'im-bar))			(eq 'lisp:plusp (find-symbol "PLUSP" 'im-bar))		)	)	(do-test "imported symbols :internal"		(and			(eq :internal (second (multiple-value-list (find-symbol "RATIONAL" 'im-bar))))			(eq :internal (second (multiple-value-list (find-symbol "PLUSP" 'im-bar))))		)	))STOP
