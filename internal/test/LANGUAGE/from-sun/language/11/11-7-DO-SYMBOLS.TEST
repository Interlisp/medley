;; Function To Be Tested: do-symbols;;;; Source: Guy L Steele's CLTL;; Section: 11.7 Package System Functions and Variables;; Page: 185;;;; ReCreated By:   Ron Fischer;;;; Creation Date: March 24, 1987;;;; Last Update:   ;;;; Filed As:      {ERIS}<LISPCORE>CML>TEST>11-7-do-symbols.test;;;;;; Syntax:        (do-symbols (var [package [result-form]]) {declaration}*;;											   {tag| statement}*;;;; Function Description: do-symbols provides straightforward iteration over the ;; symbols of a package.  The body is performed once for each symbol accessible ;; in the package, in no particular order, with the variable var bound to the;; symbol.  Then result-form (a single form, not an implicit progn) is evaluated,;; and the result is the value of the do-symbols form.  (When the result-form is;; evaluated, the control variable var is still bound and has the value of nil.);; If the result-form is omitted, the result is nil. return may be used to terminate;; the iteration prematurely.  If execution of the body affects which symbols are;; contained in the package, other than possibly to remove the symbol currently;; the value of var by using unintern, the effects are unpredictable. ;;   ;; ;; Argument(s):   var (bound to the symbol);;			   package;;			  result-form (a single form);;			  ;; Returns: value of the do-symbols form     ;;;; Constraints/Limitations: none;;;; Test description: creates two packages, one inherited by the other.  Interns a;; small number of known symbols in both packages.  For each package we remember the;; list of symbols expected to be found there and then do-symbols over the package.;; At each iteration we remove the name we found there.  NIL is returned if either;; an unknown symbol is found in the package or not all the symbols are found.(do-test "do-symbols"(let* ((inherited-package (make-package "INHERITED-PACKAGE" :use NIL))	 (direct-package (make-package "DIRECT-PACKAGE" :use "INHERITED-PACKAGE"))	 (direct-symbols '("FOO" "BAR" "BAZ" "GLORP"))	 (inherited-symbols '("IFOO" "IBAR" "IBAZ" "IGLORP"))	)	(dolist (name direct-symbols) (intern name direct-package))	(dolist (name inherited-symbols)		(export (intern name inherited-package) inherited-package)	)	(and		(let ((checking inherited-symbols))			(do-symbols (s inherited-package (and (null s) (null checking)))				(if (and (symbolp s) (member s checking :test #'string=))					(setq checking (remove s checking :test #'string=))					(return nil)				)			)		)		(let ((checking (append inherited-symbols direct-symbols)))			(do-symbols (s direct-package (and (null s) (null checking)))				(if (and (symbolp s) (member s checking :test #'string=))					(setq checking (remove s checking :test #'string=))					(return nil)				)			)		)		(delete-package "INHERITED-PACKAGE")		(delete-package "DIRECT-PACKAGE")	)))STOP
