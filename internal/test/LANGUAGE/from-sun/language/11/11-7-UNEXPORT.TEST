;; Function To Be Tested: unexport;;;; Source: Guy L Steele's CLTL;; Section: 11.7 Package System Functions and Variables;; Page: 186;;;; Created By:   John Park;;;; Creation Date: Oct 21, 1986;;;; Last Update: Dec 22, 1986  ;;;; Filed As:      {ERIS}<LISPCORE>CML>TEST>11-7-unexport.test;;;;;; Syntax:        (unexport symbols &optional package);;;; Function Description: The function unexport is provided mainly as a way to undo ;; erroneous calls to export.  It works only on symbols directly present in the current;; package, switching them back to internal status.  If unexport is given a symbol;; already accessible as an internal symbol in the current package, it does nothing.;; If it is given a symbol not accessible in the package at all, it signals an error.;; It is also an error to unexport a symbol from the keyword package.;;   ;; ;; Argument(s):  symbols (list or a single symbol) ;;			  package (optional);;			  ;; Returns:  T;;;; Constraints/Limitations: none(do-test "unexport-test-1"		(and (import 'new-symbol)			(equal :INTERNAL 				 (second (multiple-value-list (find-symbol "NEW-SYMBOL"))))			(export 'new-symbol)			(equal :EXTERNAL 				 (second (multiple-value-list (find-symbol "NEW-SYMBOL"))))			(eq (unexport '(NEW-SYMBOL)) T) 			(equal :INTERNAL				(second (multiple-value-list (find-symbol "NEW-SYMBOL"))))		))(do-test "unexport-test-2"	(let ((*test-package* (find-package 'lisp)))		(and (import 'new-symbol-xyz *test-package*)			(equal :INTERNAL 				 (second (multiple-value-list 							(find-symbol "NEW-SYMBOL-XYZ" *test-package*))))			(export 'new-symbol-xyz *test-package*)			(equal :EXTERNAL 				 (second (multiple-value-list 							(find-symbol "NEW-SYMBOL-XYZ" *test-package*))))			(eq (unexport '(NEW-SYMBOL-XYZ) *test-package*) T) 			(equal :INTERNAL				(second (multiple-value-list 							(find-symbol "NEW-SYMBOL-XYZ" *test-package*))))		)	))STOP
