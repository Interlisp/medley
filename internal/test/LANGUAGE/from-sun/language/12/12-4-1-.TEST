;; Function To Be Tested: 1-;;;; Source: Guy L Steele's CLTL;; Section: 12.4 Arithmetic Operations;; Page: 200;;;; Created By:    Kelly Roach;;;; Creation Date: July 12,1986;;;; Last Update:   July 12,1986;;;; Filed As:      {ERIS}<LISPCORE>CML>TEST>12-4-SUB1.TEST;;;;;; Syntax:        (1- NUMBER);;;; Function Description:;; (1+ X) is the same as (+ X 1).;; ;; (1- X) is the same as (- X 1).;; Note that the short name may be confusing: (1- X) does NOT mean;; 1-X; rather, it means X-1.;; Rationale: These are included primarily for compatibility with Maclisp;; and Zetalisp.  Some programmers prefer always to write (+ X 1) and;; (- X 1) instead of (1+ X) and (1- X).;; Implementation note: Compiler writers are very strongly encouraged to ensure;; that (1+ X) and (+ X 1) compile into identical code, and;; similarly for (1- X) and (- X 1), to avoid pressure on a Lisp;; programmer to write possibly less clear code for the sake of efficiency.;; This can easily be done as a source-language transformation.;; ;; Argument(s):   NUMBER - a number;;;; Returns:       a number;;(do-test sub1-test         (and (equalp (1- 3) 2)              (equalp (1- 7.0) 6.0)              (zerop (1- 1))))STOP
