;; Function To Be Tested: /;;;; Source: Guy L Steele's CLTL;; Section: 12.4 Arithmetic Operations;; Page: 200;;;; Created By:    Kelly Roach;;;; Creation Date: July 12,1986;;;; Last Update:   July 12,1986;;;; Filed As:      {ERIS}<LISPCORE>CML>TEST>12-4-QUOTIENT.TEST;;;;;; Syntax:        (/ NUMBER &REST NUMBERS);;;; Function Description:;; The function /, when given more than one argument, successively divides;; the first argument by all the others and returns the result.;; ;; With one argument, / reciprocates the argument.;; ;; / will produce a ratio if the mathematical quotient of two integers;; is not an exact integer.  For example:;; ;;     (/ 12 4) => 3;;     (/ 13 4) => 13/4;;     (/ -8) => -1/8;;     (/ 3 4 5) => 3/20;;     ;; To divide one integer by another producing an integer result,;; use one of the functions FLOOR, CEILING, TRUNCATE,;; or function ROUND.;; ;; If any argument is a floating-point number,;; then the rules of floating-point contagion apply.;; ;; Compatibility note: What / does is totally unlike what the usual;; // or QUOTIENT operator does.  In most Lisp systems,;; QUOTIENT behaves like / except when dividing integers,;; in which case it behaves like function TRUNCATE of two arguments;;; this behavior is mathematically intractable, leading to such;; anomalies as;; ;;     (QUOTIENT 1.0 2.0) => 0.5   but   (QUOTIENT 1 2) => 0;;     ;; In contrast, the Common Lisp function / produces these results:;; ;;     (/ 1.0 2.0) => 0.5          and   (/ 1 2) => 1/2;; ;;     ;; In practice QUOTIENT is used only when one is sure that both arguments;; are integers, OR when one is sure that at least one argument;; is a floating-point number.  / is tractable for its purpose;; and ``works'' for ANY numbers.;; ;; Argument(s):   NUMBER - a number;;                NUMBERS - numbers;;;; Returns:       a number;;(do-test quotient-test         (and (equalp (/ 12 3) 4)              (equalp (/ 40.0 4.0) 10.0)              (equalp (/ 1 2) .5)              (equalp (/ -8) -.125)              (equalp (/ 1.5E4 2E3) 7.5)))STOP
