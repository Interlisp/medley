;; Function To Be Tested: EXPT;;;; Source: Guy L Steele's CLTL;; Section: 12.5.1 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions;; Page: 203;;;; Created By:    Kelly Roach;;;; Creation Date: July 12,1986;;;; Last Update:   July 21, 1986, masinter, make it not require exact results;;;; Filed As:      {ERIS}<LISPCORE>CML>TEST>12-5-1-EXPT.TEST;;;;;; Syntax:        (EXPT BASE-NUMBER POWER-NUMBER);;;; Function Description:;; Returns BASE-NUMBER raised to the power POWER-NUMBER.;; If the BASE-NUMBER is of type RATIONAL and the POWER-NUMBER is;; an integer,;; the calculation will be exact and the result will be of type RATIONAL;;; otherwise a floating-point approximation may result.;; ;; When POWER-NUMBER is 0 (a zero of type integer),;; then the result is always the value one in the type of BASE-NUMBER,;; even if the BASE-NUMBER is zero (of any type).  That is:;; ;;     (EXPT X 0) = (COERCE 1 (TYPE-OF X));;     ;; If the POWER-NUMBER is a zero of any other data type,;; then the result is also the value one, in the type of the arguments;; after the application of the contagion rules, with one exception:;; it is an error if BASE-NUMBER is zero when the POWER-NUMBER;; is a zero not of type integer.;; ;; Implementations of EXPT are permitted to use different algorithms;; for the cases of a rational POWER-NUMBER and a floating-point;; POWER-NUMBER; the motivation is that in many cases greater accuracy;; can be achieved for the case of a rational POWER-NUMBER.;; For example, (EXPT PI 16) and (EXPT PI 16.0) may yield;; slightly different results if the first case is computed by repeated squaring;; and the second by the use of logarithms.  Similarly, an implementation;; might choose to compute (EXPT X 3/2) as if it had;; been written (SQRT (EXPT X 3)), perhaps producing a more accurate;; result than would (EXPT X 1.5).  It is left to the implementor;; to determine the best strategies.;; ;; The result of EXPT can be a complex number, even when neither argument;; is complex, if BASE-NUMBER is negative and POWER-NUMBER;; is not an integer.  The result is always the principal complex value.;; Note that (EXPT -8 1/3) is not permitted to return -2;;; while -2 is indeed one of the cube roots of -8, it is;; not the principal cube root, which is a complex number;; approximately equal to #C(0.5 1.73205).;; ;; Argument(s):   BASE-NUMBER - a number;;                POWER-NUMBER - a number;;;; Returns:       a number;;(do-test expt-test         (flet ((closep (x y) (< (abs (- x y)) (* .00001 (/ (+ (abs x) (abs y)) 2)))))		(and (= (expt 1233 0) 1)              (= (expt 0 5) 0)              (closep (expt 28.8 0) 1)              (closep (expt -2 9) -512)              (closep (expt 3 4) 81)              (closep (expt 2 -1) 0.5)              (closep (expt 10000 0.25) 10.0)              (closep (expt (/ 3 4) 2) 0.5625))))STOP
