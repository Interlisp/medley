;; Function To Be Tested: FFLOOR;;;; Source: Guy L Steele's CLTL;; Section: 12.6 Type Conversions and Component Extractions on Numbers;; Page: 217;;;; Created By:    Kelly Roach, John Park;;;; Creation Date: July 12,1986;;;; Last Update:   July 12,1986;;;; Filed As:      {ERIS}<LISPCORE>CML>TEST>12-6-FFLOOR.TEST;;;;;; Syntax:        (FFLOOR NUMBER &OPTIONAL DIVISOR);;;; Function Description:;; These functions are just like FLOOR, CEILING, TRUNCATE, and;; ROUND, except that the result (the first result of two) is always a;; floating-point number rather than an integer.  It is roughly as if;; FFLOOR gave its arguments to FLOOR, and then applied FLOAT to;; the first result before passing them both back.  In practice, however,;; FFLOOR may be implemented much more efficiently.  Similar remarks;; apply to the other three functions.  If the first argument is a;; floating-point number, and the second argument is not a floating-point;; number of shorter format, then the first result will be a floating-point;; number of the same type as the first argument.;; For example:;; ;;     (FFLOOR -4.7) => -5.0 AND 0.3;;     (FFLOOR 3.5D0) => 3.0D0 AND 0.5D0;;     ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; Argument(s):   NUMBER - a number;;                DIVISOR - a real;;;; Returns:       a number;;(do-test-group ffloor-setup  :before (progn            (setq arguments '(2.6 2.5 2.4 0.7 0.3 -0.3 -0.7 -2.4 -2.5 -2.6))           (setq ffloor-result1                  '(2.0 2.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 -1.0 -1.0 -3.0 -3.0 -3.0))           (setq arguments-option '((33.0 10) (35.0 10) (36.0 10)))           (setq ffloor-result2 '(3.0 3.0 3.0)))  (do-test ffloor-test    (and (setq ffloor-test-result1 (mapcar #'ffloor arguments))         (equal ffloor-test-result1 ffloor-result1)         (setq ffloor-test-result2                (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (append '(ffloor) x))                        arguments-option))         (equal (mapcar #'eval ffloor-test-result2)                ffloor-result2))))STOP
