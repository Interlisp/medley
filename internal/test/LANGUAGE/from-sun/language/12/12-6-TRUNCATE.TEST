The DIVISOR may be any non-complex number.;; The one-argument case is exactly like the two-argument case where the second;; argument is 1.;; ;; ;; ;; ;; ;; Each of the functions actually returns TWO values,;; whether given one or two arguments.  The second;; result is the remainder and may be obtained using;; ;; macro MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND and related constructs.;; If any of these functions is given two arguments X and Y;; and produces results Q and R, then Q*Y+R=X.;; The first result Q is always an integer.;; The remainder R is an integer if both arguments are integers,;; is rational if both arguments are rational,;; and is floating-point if either argument is floating-point.;; One consequence is that;; in the one-argument case the remainder is always a number of the same type;; as the argument.;; ;; When only one argument is given, the two results are exact;;; the mathematical sum of the two results is always equal to the;; mathematical value of the argument.;; ;; Compatibility note: The names of the functions FLOOR, CEILING,;; TRUNCATE, and ROUND are more accurate than names like FIX;; that have heretofore been used in various Lisp systems.;; The names used here are compatible with standard mathematical;; terminology (and with PL1, as it happens).  In Fortran;; IFIX means TRUNCATE.  Algol 68 provides ROUND;; and uses ENTIER to mean FLOOR.;; In Maclisp, FIX and IFIX both;; mean FLOOR (one is generic, the other flonum-in/fixnum-out).;; In Interlisp, FIX means TRUNCATE.;; In Zetalisp, FIX means FLOOR and FIXR means ROUND.;; Standard Lisp provides a FIX function but does not;; specify precisely what it does.  The existing usage;; of the name FIX is so confused that it seemed best to avoid it;; altogether.;; ;; The names and definitions given here have recently been adopted;; by Zetalisp, and Maclisp and NIL seem likely to follow suit.;; ;; Argument(s):   NUMBER - a number;;                DIVISOR - a real;;;; Returns:       a number;;(do-test-group truncate-setup  :before (progn            (setq arguments                 '(2.6 2.5 2.4 0.7 0.3 -0.3 -0.7 -2.4 -2.5 -2.6))           (setq truncate-result1 '(2 2 2 0 0 0 0 -2 -2 -2))           (setq arguments-option '((33 10) (35 10) (36 10)))           (setq truncate-result2 '(3 3 3)))  (do-test truncate-test    (and (setq truncate-test-result1 (mapcar #'truncate arguments))         (equal truncate-test-result1 truncate-result1)         (setq truncate-test-result2                (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (append '(truncate) x))                        arguments-option))         (equal (mapcar #'eval truncate-test-result2)                truncate-result2))))	STOP
