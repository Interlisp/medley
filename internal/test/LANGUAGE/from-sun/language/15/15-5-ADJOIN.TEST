The equality test defaults to EQL.;; ;;     (ADJOIN ITEM LIST) = (IF (MEMBER ITEM LIST) LIST (CONS ITEM LIST));;     ;; In general, the test may be any predicate; the ITEM is added to the;; list only if there is no element of the list that ``satisfies the;; test.'';; ;; ADJOIN deviates from the usual rules described in chapter;; for the treatment of arguments named ITEM and :KEY.;; If a :KEY function is specified, it is applied to ITEM;; as well as to each element of the list.  The rationale is that;; if the ITEM is not yet in the list, it soon will be, and so;; the test is more properly viewed as being between two elements;; rather than between a separate ITEM and an element.;; ;;     (ADJOIN ITEM LIST :KEY FN);;       = (IF (MEMBER (FN ITEM) LIST :KEY FN) LIST (CONS ITEM LIST));;     ;; See macro PUSHNEW.;; ;; Argument(s):   ITEM - anything;;                LIST - a list;;                TEST - a function;;                TEST-NOT - a function;;                KEY - a function;;;; Returns:       a pure list;;(DO-TEST "ADJOIN TEST 1" (EQUAL (ADJOIN (QUOTE (1 2))                                       (QUOTE ((1 2)                                               (3 4)))                                       :TEST                                       (QUOTE EQUAL))                                (QUOTE ((1 2)                                        (3 4))))       (EQUAL (ADJOIN (QUOTE (1 2))                     (QUOTE ((3 4)))                     :TEST                     (QUOTE EQUAL))              (QUOTE ((1 2)                      (3 4))))       (EQUAL (ADJOIN (QUOTE (1 2))                     (QUOTE ((1 2)                             (3 4)))                     :TEST-NOT                     (QUOTE EQUAL))              (QUOTE ((1 2)                      (3 4))))       (EQUAL (ADJOIN (QUOTE (1 2))                     (QUOTE ((3 4)))                     :TEST-NOT                     (QUOTE EQUAL))              (QUOTE ((3 4))))       (EQUAL (ADJOIN (QUOTE (1 2))                     (QUOTE ((3 4)                             (1 2)                             (2 1)                             (3 4)))                     :TEST                     (QUOTE EQUAL))              (QUOTE ((3 4)                      (1 2)                      (2 1)                      (3 4))))       (EQUAL (ADJOIN (QUOTE (1 2))                     NIL :TEST-NOT (QUOTE EQUAL))              (QUOTE ((1 2))))       (EQUAL (ADJOIN (QUOTE (1 2))                     NIL :TEST (QUOTE EQUAL))              (QUOTE ((1 2))))       (EQUAL (ADJOIN (QUOTE (1 2))                     NIL :TEST (QUOTE EQL))              (QUOTE ((1 2))))       (EQUAL (ADJOIN (QUOTE (1 2))                     (QUOTE ((1 2)))                     :TEST                     (QUOTE EQL))              (QUOTE ((1 2)                      (1 2)))))STOP
