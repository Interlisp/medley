;; Definition To Be Tested: finish-output, force-output, and clear-output;;;; Source:        Xerox LIsp Manual ;; Chapter 22-3-1: Input/Output  Output to Character Streams;;;; Created By:    Kirk Kelley;;;; Creation Date:  21 November 86;;;; Last Update:   >> day month << 86 ;;;; Filed As:      {eris}<lispcore>cml>test>22-3-1-finish-output.test;;;;;; Syntax: finish-output &optional output-stream               ;;;; Function Description: The function finish-output attempts to ensure that all output sent to output-stream has reached its destination, and only then returns nil.  force-output initiates the emptying of any internal buffers but returns nil without waiting for completion or acknowledgment.  The function clear-output, on the other hand, attempts to abort any outstanding output operation in progress in order to allow as little output as possible to continue to the desitnation.;;;; Argument(s):  output-stream;;;; Returns: nil;;;; These tests just test that the functions dont break for a variety of devices.  It could be improved by putting out a huge string or simulating a slow channel by advising \bufferedbout (whatever its called) and do some elapsed time tests after each type of output.  Then do an input-test to see if all the characters made it (or not in the case of clear-output).;;(DO-TEST LOAD-CH-21-FUNCTIONS(OR (BOUNDP '21-FUNCTIONS-HAVE-BEEN-LOADED)(LOAD "21-functions.def"))) (DO-TEST("finish-output" :AFTER(DOLIST (STREAM-NAME STREAM-IO-NAMES)(DELETE-FILE STREAM-NAME)))(DOLIST (STREAM-NAME STREAM-IO-NAMES T)(WITH-OPEN-FILE(ASTREAM STREAM-NAME :DIRECTION :OUTPUT)(OUTPUT-TEST ASTREAM :KEEP-OPEN)(FINISH-OUTPUT ASTREAM)(CLOSE ASTREAM)(WITH-OPEN-FILE (ASTREAM STREAM-NAME)(UNLESS (INPUT-TEST ASTREAM)(PRINT-STREAM-ERROR "finish-output"STREAM-NAME)))))) (DO-TEST("force-output" :AFTER(DOLIST (STREAM-NAME STREAM-IO-NAMES)(DELETE-FILE STREAM-NAME)))(DOLIST (STREAM-NAME STREAM-IO-NAMES T)(WITH-OPEN-FILE(ASTREAM STREAM-NAME :DIRECTION :OUTPUT)(OUTPUT-TEST ASTREAM :KEEP-OPEN)(FORCE-OUTPUT ASTREAM)(CLOSE ASTREAM)(WITH-OPEN-FILE (ASTREAM STREAM-NAME)(UNLESS (INPUT-TEST ASTREAM)(PRINT-STREAM-ERROR "finish-output"STREAM-NAME)))))) (DO-TEST ("clear-output" :AFTER(DOLIST (STREAM-NAME STREAM-IO-NAMES)(DELETE-FILE STREAM-NAME)))(DOLIST (STREAM-NAME STREAM-IO-NAMES T)(WITH-OPEN-FILE (ASTREAM STREAM-NAME:DIRECTION :OUTPUT)(OUTPUT-TEST ASTREAM:KEEP-OPEN)(CLEAR-OUTPUT ASTREAM)(CLOSE ASTREAM))))
