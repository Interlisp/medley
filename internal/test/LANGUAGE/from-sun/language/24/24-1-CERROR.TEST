;; Function To Be Tested: cerror;;;; Source: Guy L Steele's CLTL;; Section: 24.1 ERRORS (General Error-Signalling Functions);; Page: 431;;;; Created By:   John Park;;;; Creation Date: Nov 3, 1986;;;; Last Update:   ;;;; Filed As:      {ERIS}<LISPCORE>CML>TEST>24-1-cerror.test;;;;;; Syntax:        (cerror format-string &rest args);;;; Function Description: This function is used to signal continuable errors.  Like error,;; it signals an error and enters the debugger.  However, cerror allows the program to;; be continued from the debugger after resolving the error.  If the program is continued;; after encountering the error, cerror returns nil.  The code that follows the call to;; error will then be executed. This code should correct the problem, perhaps by ;; accepting a new value from the user if a variable was invalid.;;;; Argument(s): format-string: Error message (same way that error uses it).;;			continue-format-string:  This is given as a control string to format;;				along with the args to construct a message string.;;			Args: ;;			  ;; Returns:     T;;;; Constraints/Limitations: Due to the nature of cerror function, which enters the;; debugger (break), this test should be conducted manually to see if correct error;; messages are returned.  It's unrealistic to execute this kind of test automatically;; though it is not impossible.(do-test-group ("cerror-test-setup"		:before (progn				(defun cerror-example (vals)					"**This is an example of where the caller of cerror, if						continued, fixes the problem without any further						user interaction**"					(let ((nvals (list-length vals)))					   (unless (= nvals 3)						(cond ((< nvals 3)							(cerror "Assume missing values are zero."								   "Too few values in ~S;~%~									three are required, ~									but ~R ~:[were~;was~] supplied."									nvals (= nvals 1))							(setq vals (append vals (subseq '(0 0 0) nvals))))						(T (cerror "Ignore all values after the first three."								 "Too many values in ~S;~%~								  three are required, ~								  but ~R were supplied."								  nvals)							(setq vals (subseq vals 0 3))))))					)				 (defun known-wordp (word)					"**This is called by the second cerror-example and returns						T if it is a member of the known-wordp-list**"					(if (member word '(this is a known wordp list))  T)				  )				(defun cerror-example-2 (word)					" In this example a loop is used to ensure that a test						is satisfied"					(do ()						((known-wordp word) word)					   (cerror "You will be prompted for a replacement word."							"~S is an unknown word (possible misspelled)."							word)					   (format *query-io* "~&New word: ")					   (setq word (read *query-io*)))				  )							 )		)(do-test "cerror-exist?"		 (fboundp 'cerror))(do-test "cerror-test-1"		 (eq (cerror-example '(1 2 3)) NIL))(do-test "cerror-test-2"		(and (eq (cerror-example-2 'WORDP) 'WORDP)			(eq (cerror-example-2 'THIS) 'THIS)		))		;; The following tests should be performed manually;;;; Does the following test return the delineated error message in a similar format;; if not totally identical?
