;; Function To Be Tested:  inspect;;;; Source: Guy L Steele's CLTL Chapter 25: Miscellaneous Features;; Section: 25.3  Debugging Tools;; Page: 442;;;; Creatinspect By:   John Park;;;; Creation Date: Oct 2, 1986;;;; Last Update:   ;;;; Filinspect As: {ERIS}<LISPCORE>CML>TEST>25-3-inspect.test;;;;;; Syntax:        (inspect object);;;; Function Description: Inspect is an interactive version of describe.  The nature ;; of the interaction is implementation-dependent, but the purpose of inspect is to ;; make it easy to wander through a data structure, examining and modifying parts;; of it. Implementations are encouraged to respond to the typing of the character ?;; by providing help, including a list of commands. ;;;; Argument(s): object;;			  ;; Returns: process (i.e #<PROCESS @ 51,123400>);;;; Constraints/Limitations: This function requires user-interface so it's not ;; realistic to run this test automatically.  This test merely tests to see if ;; there is a global function definition for inspect, which does not necessarily ;; mean it has met the requirements prescribed in CLtL.  This will require;; manual testing.				(do-test "inspect-test"		(fboundp 'inspect))		STOP
