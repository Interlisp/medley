If, however, a return or return-from form that specifies the same name is executed during;;					 the execution of some form, then the results specified by the return or return-from are immediately;;					 returned as the value of the block construct, and execution proceeds as if the block had terminated;;					 normally.;;;; Argument(s):           NAME - a symbol;;					FORM -  a valid lisp form;;;; Returns:               anything    ;;(do-test-group (test-block-group				:before	(progn 							(test-defun hairyfun (x) (list x "hairyfun"))							(test-defun fun (x)									(typecase x										((integer 100 *) (return-from fun "x >= 100")     )										((mod 100)       (return-from fun "100 > x >= 0") )										(t               (return-from fun "0 > x")       )  )									("wrong!!"))						))	(do-test "test block - test case copied from page 120 of CLtL"		(and			(equal (block loser					(catch 'stuff						(mapcar #'(lambda (x) (if (numberp x)											 (hairyfun x)											 (return-from loser nil))) 								'(23 24 35 36)))) 				 '( (23 "hairyfun") (24 "hairyfun") (35 "hairyfun") (36 "hairyfun")))			(eq    (block loser					(catch 'stuff						(mapcar #'(lambda (x) (if (numberp x)											 (hairyfun x)											 (return-from loser nil))) 								'(#\q 24 35 36)))) 				  '())			(equal (multiple-value-list (block loser									(catch 'stuff										(mapcar #'(lambda (x) (if (numberp x)															 (hairyfun x)											 				(return-from loser (values 'multiple 'values))))												`(t nil t nil)))))				  '(multiple values)) 		 )	)	(do-test "test block - the body of a defun form is a block construct which has the same name as the function"		;;		;; fun was defined in :before section		;;		(and 			(equal (fun 150) "x >= 100")			(equal (fun -9)  "0 > x")			(equal (fun 87)  "100 > x >= 0") 		)		))(do-test "test block - block construct returns whatever is returned by the last form"	(and		(eq     (block name1) nil)		(=      (block name2 (1+ 99)) 100)		(equal  (block name3 (append '(2 3 4) '(0 9 8))) '(2 3 4 0 9 8))		(equal  (multiple-value-list (block name  (values #\a #\b #\c))) '(#\a #\b #\c))		(equalp (block name1 (concatenate 'bit-vector #*0000 #*1111)) #*00001111)		(equal  (block name2 ( (lambda (x) (cons x x))  9)) '(9 . 9))	))(do-test "test block - nested blocks"  (flet ((fun (y)	 	 (let (temp)	 		 (block outblk				 (setq temp (mapcar #'(lambda (x) 									(cons x (block blk 		  			 		 (typecase  x                 					(number (return-from blk '( is a number)))			  					(list   (return-from blk '( is a list)))			 					(string (return-from blk '( is a string)))								(t       (return-from outblk "wrong input !!"))  )))) 						    y))				  (if (null temp) (return-from outblk "no input"))				  (setq temp (cons "Results:"  temp))			 )		  )	   ))	   (and (equal (fun nil) "no input")		   (equal (fun '(1  "fg")) '("Results:" (1 is a number) ("fg" is a string)))		   (equal (fun '( (2 3) 100 20 "fgh" "as"))			     '("Results:"  ((2 3) is a list) (100 is a number ) (20 is a number) ("fgh" is a string) 						    ("as" is a string)))		   (equal (fun '(#*0101 3)) "wrong input !!")	   )  ))STOP
