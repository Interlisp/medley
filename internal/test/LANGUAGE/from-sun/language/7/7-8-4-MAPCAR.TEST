In the chapter on sequences;; it is explained why this was a bad choice.  Here the name MAP;; is used for the far more useful generic sequence mapper,;; in closer accordance to the computer science literature,;; especially the growing body of papers on functional programming.;; These functions are used when the function is being called merely for its;; side effects, rather than its returned values.;; The value returned by MAPL or MAPC is the second argument,;; that is, the first sequence argument.;; ;; MAPCAN and MAPCON are like MAPCAR and MAPLIST respectively,;; except that they combine the results of;; the function using function NCONC instead of LIST.  That is,;; ;;     (MAPCON F X1 ... XN);;        = (APPLY #'NCONC (MAPLIST F X1 ... XN));;     ;; and similarly for the relationship between MAPCAN and MAPCAR.;; Conceptually, these functions allow the mapped function to return;; a variable number of items to be put into the output list.;; This is particularly useful for effectively returning zero or one item:;; ;;     (MAPCAN #'(LAMBDA (X) (AND (NUMBERP X) (LIST X)));;     	'(A 1 B C 3 4 D 5));; ;;       => (1 3 4 5);;     ;; In this case the function serves as a filter; this is a standard Lisp;; idiom using MAPCAN.;; (The function function REMOVE-IF-NOT might have been useful in this;; particular context, however.);; Remember that NCONC is a destructive operation, and therefore;; so are MAPCAN and MAPCON; the lists returned by the FUNCTION;; are altered in order to concatenate them.;; ;; Sometimes a DO or a straightforward recursion is preferable to a;; mapping operation;  however, the mapping functions should be used wherever they;; naturally apply because this increases the clarity of the code. ;; ;; The functional argument to a mapping function must be acceptable;; to APPLY; it cannot be a macro or the name of a special form.;; Of course, there is nothing wrong with using a function that has ;; and  parameters as the functional argument.;; ;; Argument(s):   FUNCTION - a function;;                LIST - a pure list;;                MORE-LISTS - a pure list;;;; Returns:       a pure list;;;;;;(do-test "test mapcar0 - syntax checking";;    (not (or (nlsetq (mapcar #'+));;             (nlsetq (mapcar #'- '(1 2 3) 4 5 6));;             (nlsetq (mapcar #'* 'a 'b 'c 'd (list 3 6 9)));;             (nlsetq (mapcar #'car (+ 2 3) (char-code #\a) (cons 1 2)));;             (prog1  nil (makunbound 'fun));;            (nlsetq (mapcar #'fun '(1)));;            (nlsetq (mapcar 'm 'n 'o 'p));;            (nlsetq (mapcar #'progn '(1 2))))))(do-test "test mapcar1 - test cases copied from p128 of CLtL"    (and (equal (mapcar #'abs '(3 -4 2 -5 -6)) '(3 4 2 5 6))         (equal (mapcar #'cons '(a b c) '(1 2 3)) '((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3)))))(do-test "test mapcar2 - sqrt & gcd"    (and (equal (mapcar #'sqrt (list 10000 400 9 144  169 81 121 #31r100 #27r100 #17r10000))                               '(100.0 20.0 3.0 12.0 13.0 9.0 11.0 31.0 27.0 289.0))         (equal (mapcar #'gcd '(10 3 9) '(20 9 45) '(30 27 54)) '(10 3 9))))(do-test "test mapcar3 - max & append"    (and (equal (mapcar #'max '(10 20 30 40 50) '(1 200 3 49 5)) '(10 200 30 49 50))         (equal (mapcar #'append  '((2 4 6) (1 3 5)) '((12 14 16) (11 13 15)))                '((2 4 6 12 14 16)(1 3 5 11 13 15)))))(do-test "test mapcar4 - subst & list & null"    (and (equal (mapcar #'subst '(hat ball pink) '(chair pen blue)                                 '((this is my chair) (that is your pen) (blue is a nice color)))               '((this is my hat) (that is your ball) (pink is a nice color)))         (equal (mapcar #'list '(1) '(2) `(,(+ 1 2)) (list 4) (cons 5 nil) (car '((6))) '(7) '(8) (cdr '(nil 9))                               '(10) '(11) (list (- 14 2)) (progn '(13)) `(,#14r10) (union '(15) nil))                '((1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15)))         (equal (mapcar #'null (list t nil 'non-nil '()))  '(nil t nil t))))(do-test "test mapcar5 - lambda list"    (equal (mapcar #'(lambda (fn1 fn2 fn3)                                   (let ((x 10) (y 20))                                       (list (funcall fn1 x y)                                             (funcall fn2 x y)                                             (funcall fn3 x y))))  '(+ - *) '(gcd >= cons) '(list eq min))              '((30 10 (10 20)) (-10 nil nil) (200 (10 . 20) 10)))) (do-test "test mapcar6 - tests with different length of lists"          (and (equal (mapcar #'>= '(8 20 93) '(87 -40 900 -2) '(2 81 90)) '(nil nil nil))              (equal (mapcar #'expt '(2 4 6) '(1)) '(2))              (eq    (mapcar #'+ '(1 2 3) '()) nil)))STOP
