;; Function To Be Tested:  dribble;;;; Source: CLTL Chapter 25:Miscellaneous Features;; Section: 25.3  Debugging Tools;; Page: 443;;;; Created By:   John Park;;;; Creation Date: Sep 10, 1986;;;; Last Update:   October 9, 1986, Herb Jellinek, Dec 15, 86, John PARK;;;; Filed As: {ERIS}<LISPCORE>CML>TEST>25-3-dribble.test;;;;;; Syntax:        (dribble &optional pathname);;;; Function Description: (dribble pathname) rebinds *standard-input* and *standard-;; output*, and/or takes other appropriate action, so as to send a record of the ;; input/output interaction to a file named by pathname.  (dribble) terminates the;; recording of input and output and closes the dribble file.;;;; Argument(s):  pathname (optional);;			  ;; Returns:  NIL when opened and the name of dribble file when it's closed. ;;;; Constraints/Limitations: Due to differences in filenaming convention among;; various operating systems, only xerox implementation is tested.  For other;; systems, use appropriate filenames for the test. ;;;;;; Watch out for implementation-dependent filenames below ;;(do-test-group 	("dribble-test-setup"	:before	(progn 				(defun file-exists?
