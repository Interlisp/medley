Debugger, Error System, and Unwinder test report

This report is for tests written and executed up to March 24, 1987 on the <Lyric>Basics>Full.Sysout generated 11-Mar-87.

The following tests are for the integration of the new error system into the Interlisp environment.  

The source for this report is {Erinyes}<Test>Lisp>Lyric>Plans>Debugger.NoteFile

The print version of this test report is filed at {Eris}<Lispcore>Test>Debugger>Report.IP

The test plan is filed at {Erinyes}<Test>Lisp>Lyric>Plans>Debugger.NoteFile and IP.

Groups of tests were written and executed on the 1109 for all the commands in the Debugger document in the Xerox Common Lisp implementation notes.

These are stored on {eris}<Lispcore>Test>Debugger>BreakWindow.u

Groups of tests were written and executed on the 1109 for most of the functions in IRM chapter 15: Breaking, Tracing, and Advising.

These are mostly automatic tests but some require user interaction.  They are stored in {Eris}<Lispcore>Test>Debugger>Debugger.u

For tests of the Xerox extentions to the CML error system, see {Eris}<Lispcore>cml>test>24-*.
