;; Function To Be Tested: USE (EXEC Command);;;; Source: Xerox Common Lisp Implementation Notes (Lyric Beta Release);;		 Section 20.2 (The Evaluator), Page 26;;;; Section: The Evaluator;;;; Created By:   John Park;;;; Creation Date: Feb 4, 1987;;;; Last Update:  Feb 27, 1987 ;;;; Filed As:      {ERIS}<lispcore>test>exec>USE-event.u;;;;;; Syntax:        USE NEW [FOR OLD] [IN EventSpec];;;; Function Description: Substitutes NEW for OLD in the events specified by;; EventSpec, and redoes the result.  NEW and OLD can include lists or symbols.;; ;; Argument(s):  EvenSpec (number or sequence);;			  ;; Returns:       Results of substituted variables in the previous event;;;; Constraints/Limitations: Due to the nature of Programmer's Assistant commands,;; testing them willbe accomplished by using the interlisp function bksysbuf ;; in do-test form.  Comments are incorporated within  each command file. ;; The do-test test setup is titled "USE", which executes the command ;; string. The do-test form within the command file will return T or "test "quote" ;; failed in file "unknown". " This test file requires TEDIT package.  ;; The test result will be logged automatically in the following file:;; {ERIS}<lispcore>test>exec>test.report(DO-TEST	"USE-TEST-SETUP"	(PROGN		(SETQ TEST-RESULT "{ERIS}<LISPCORE>TEST>EXEC>TEST.REPORT")		(DEFUN R-FORMAT (STATUS) 			(FORMAT *OUTPUT* "~%COMMAND: USE ~%STATUS:  ~A  DATE:  ~A  TESTER:  ~A~%" STATUS (IL:DATE) IL:USERNAME))		 (SETQ USE-COMMAND-STRING"(setq sin-val (sin 0));; The following will use COS instead of SIN in the previous eventUSE COS for SIN(= sin-val (cos 0)) ; Should return T(setq val-1 (sin 1.5))(setq val-2 (sin 2.0));; The following should substitute COS  for every occurrence of SIN in the previous;; two events, and substitute (- X) for every occurence of X, and reexecute them.USE COS (- X) for SIN X IN -2 and -1(and (= val-1 (cos -1.5))	(= val-2 (cos -2.0)))(fboundp 'tan)(boundp 'sin)(boundp 'pi)(setq new-variable 'xyz);; The following should return nilUSE FBOUNDP FOR BOUNDP(fboundp '*package*)(boundp '*package*);; The following has the same effect as USE BOUNDP FOR FBOUNDP and should return TUSE BOUNDP FOR FBOUNDP IN F FBOUNDP(setq sin 'trig-function);;FBOUNDP(SIN);; The following is equivalent to USE BOUNDP FOR FBOUNDP IN -1USE BOUNDP(makunbound 'sin)(DO-TEST 'USE-TEST-RESULT   	(PROG2 (SETQ *OUTPUT* (OPEN TEST-RESULT :DIRECTION :OUTPUT		 		:IF-EXISTS  :APPEND))            (IF (AND (= SIN-VAL (COS 0))				(AND (= VAL-1 (COS -1.5))					(= VAL-2 (COS -2.0))				)			)				(PROGN (R-FORMAT 'SUCCESS) T)				(PROGN (R-FORMAT 'FAIL) NIL))             (CLOSE *OUTPUT*)	))")	(IL:BKSYSBUF USE-COMMAND-STRING)	))STOP
