;; Function To Be Tested: NAME  (Programmer's Assistant Command);;;; Source: Xerox Common Lisp Implementation Notes (Lyric Beta Release);;		CLtL, Section 20.2 (The Evaluator);; Section: The Evaluator;; Page: 28;;;; Created By:   John Park;;;; Creation Date: Feb 24, 1987;;;; Last Update:   ;;;; Filed As:      {ERIS}<lispcore>test>exec>name.u;;;;;; Syntax:        NAME  COMMAND-NAME &optional ARGUMENTS &rest EVENT-SPEC;;;; Function Description: Similar to REDO except sets the debugger parameters;; so that any errrors that occur while executing EventSpec will cause breaks.;; ;; Argument(s):  Command-Name, Arguments, and Event-Spec;;			  ;; Returns:     See function description;;;; Constraints/Limitations: Due to the nature of Programmer's Assistant commands,;; testing them willbe accomplished by using the interlisp function bksysbuf ;; in do-test form.  Comments are incorporated within  each command file. ;; Each test setup is titled "NAME-TEST-SETUP", which executes the command ;; string. The do-test form within the command file will return T or "test "quote" ;; failed in file "unknown". " This test file requires TEDIT package.  ;; The test result will be logged automatically in the following file:;; {ERIS}<lispcore>test>exec>test.report;;;; Messages will be printed before each command in the command files is executed;; for user monitoring.   Test result is logged on ;; {eris}<lispcore>test>exec>test.report. (DO-TEST "NAME-TEST-SETUP"	(PROGN 		(SETQ MESS0 "Setting the variable today-1...") 		(SETQ MESS1 "Defining a new command DATE using DA...")		(SETQ MESS2 "Setting and resetting FOO...")		(SETQ MESS3 "Defining a new command called Foo-2, which will return the value assigned when foo was reset for the second time...")		(SETQ MESS4 "Now do-test will determine if correct results have been produced...") 		(SETQ TEST-RESULT "{ERIS}<LISPCORE>TEST>EXEC>TEST.REPORT")		(DEFUN R-FORMAT (STATUS)				(FORMAT *OUTPUT* "~%COMMAND: NAME ~%STATUS:  ~A  DATE:  ~A  TESTER:  ~A~%" STATUS (IL:DATE) IL:USERNAME))(SETQ NAME-COMMAND-STRING "(FORMAT NIL MESS0)DA(SETQ TODAY-1 CL:*)(FORMAT NIL MESS1)NAME DATE DADATE(SETQ TODAY-2 CL:*)(FORMAT NIL MESS2)(SETQ FOO 'FIRST-FOO)(SETQ FOO 'SECOND-FOO)(SETQ FOO 'THIRD-FOO)NAME FOO-2 FOO -2FOO-2(SETQ NEW-FOO CL:*)(FORMAT NIL MESS3)(DO-TEST 'NAME-TEST-RESULT   	(PROG2 (SETQ *OUTPUT* (OPEN TEST-RESULT :DIRECTION :OUTPUT		 		:IF-EXISTS  :APPEND))            (IF (AND (STRING-EQUAL TODAY-1 TODAY-2 :END1 16 :END2 16)				(EQ NEW-FOO 'SECOND-FOO))				(PROGN (R-FORMAT 'SUCCESS) T)				(PROGN (R-FORMAT 'FAIL) NIL))             (CLOSE *OUTPUT*)	))")		(IL:BKSYSBUF NAME-COMMAND-STRING)	))STOP
