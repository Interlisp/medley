Masterscope is an interactive;; program for analyzing and cross referencing user programs.  It contains;; facilities for analyzing user functions to determine what other functions are;; called, how and where variables are bound, set, or referenced, as well as ;; which functions use particular record declarations.  Masterscope is able to;; analyze definitions directly from a file as well as in-core definitions. ;; This test is almost identical to the masterscope as an exec command, which is;; located in {eris}<lispcore>test>exec>masterscope.u;; ;; Argument(s):  Masterscope commands (SEE IRM, Vol 3, Section 19);;			  ;; Returns:     (SEE IRM, Vol 3, Section 19);;;; Constraints/Limitations: Due to the nature of Programmer's Assistant commands,;; testing them will  be performed using do-test and the interlisp function bksysfuf.;; Comments or messages are incorporated within ;; each command file, which will be run by using the function bksysbuf.  ;; Each test setup is titled "MASTERSCOPE-TEST-SETUP", which executes the command ;; string. The do-test form within the command file will return T or "test ;; failed" This test file requires TEDIT and MASTERSCOPE package;; The tree structure of the functions being analyzed are as follows:;;;;				  Top-Funtion;;					  |;;	      Fun-A------------------------Fun-B;;		  |						|;;    ---------------------              --------------------;;    |		  |	      |			|         |	    |;;  Fun-A1  Fun-A2  Fun-A3	  	 Fun-B1	 Fun-B2	  Fun-B3;;						     	   |;;					    	  --------------;;					   	  |		     |;;				     	   Fun-C1	       Fun-A1;;;; Messages will be printed before each command in the command files is executed;; for user monitoring.
