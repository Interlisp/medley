library/CLIPBOARD

Written by Ron Kaplan, 2020-2021

A small package that implements copy and paste to the system clipboard.

It arms meta-C for copy to the clipboard from the current selection of an application that has been armed (Tedit, Sedit), and also meta-X for extraction (copy followed by delete).

Meta-V is defined as an interrupt character that pastes the current clipboard contents into whatever process curent has input focus.

The information in the clipboard can be provided from or provided to external (non-Medley) applications (mail, emacs, etc.) in the usual way.  For example, a form cselected in SEDIT can be copied to the clipboard and pasted into an email message.

It assumes that the clipboard is a utf-8/unicode stream, and uses the UNICODE package to convert to and from the Medley internal character encoding (XCCS).

The name of the clipboard stream may differ from platform to platform.  On the Mac, the paste stream is "pbpaste" and the copy stream is "pbcopy".  Those names are used if "darwin" is a substring of (UNIX-GETENV "ostype").  Otherwise both stream-names default to "xclip".  The functions CLIPBOARD-COPY-STREAM and CLIPBOARD-PASTE-STREAM perform this selection.
