the end-user documentation for Lafite in a PDF is on Google Drive

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zb2IudbnlzfEK5YzTcEr7k2liclFUquE?usp=sharing

Here (in the GitHub Interlisp/medley repo) 
you will find the .TEdit sources that can be used to produce the documentation using ths utility HCFILES on the file MEDLEY-UTILS in the "internal" folder.

For Lafite there are two folders, one with the (latest) documentation and one with release notes.
