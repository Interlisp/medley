This file implements little commands:

cd               change Lisp's current directory to home
cd dir           dir can be a path separated by / or >.
                 if no "hostname" is given, it's assumed {DSK}
ls [dir]         list current directory or a directory that's given
                 non-feature: ls foo only prints foo; you need to
		 specify        ls foo/
pwd		 print working directory
