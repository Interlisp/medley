			TMAX Introduction


TMAX (Tedit  Macros And  eXtensions)  is a  package that  extends  the
capabilities of TEdit by providing a  menu of commands that allow  the
user to  do such  things as  indexing, writing  a sorted  index  file,
arbitrary numbering, creating  a list of  notes, referencing  numbered
objects by their numeric value, and writing a table-of-contents  file.
There is also an  extensive help file describing  all the features  of
TMAX. Rather than include examples of  how to use these features,  the
help file was written using these features and is both an example  and
a description of using TMAX.

Before you can read the help  file, you must first load the  TMAX.DCOM
file   from    the     {CSLI}<LISP.KOTO>    directory.    Then    copy
{CSLI}<LISP.KOTO>TMAX.TEDIT to your local disk. Open up a TEdit window
and do a TEdit Get on {DSK}TMAX.TEDIT. The reason for copying the file
to the local disk  is that, due  to problems with  the leaf server  on
csli, TMAX runs a lot smoother  when the source files are on  non-leaf
hosts.  

When you load the TMAX.TEDIT file, you will see the TMAX menu appended
to the top of your TEdit window. You invoke TMAX commands by buttoning
items in this menu.  If you would  like a hardcopy  of the help  file,
first button Update and then Insert Endnotes (both in the TMAX  menu).
Then point the mouse at  the black title bar at  the top of the  TEdit
window and select Hardcopy from the right button menu.
