# medley/loadups

This directory is for holding the sysouts from a release
* lisp.sysout    (the system in the IRM + Common Lisp)
* full.sysout    (lisp + modernizations + TEdit and others)
   
* starter.sysout you have to have a running Medley to make a new one(!)
  this file is just a stable place to stand.

* whereis.hash  A "hash file" directory index of everything

* lisp.venuesysout full.venuesysout -- vintage sysouts for comparision

Plus, if you make your own loadups (from BUILDING.md) you'll see some .dribble files which are the logs of the build proccess.
