Notes on making a Sun Loadup

update Jan. 25, 1990 by osamu

In a medley sysout on cottonmouth do the following:

-- Make sure all the files are current.  There are SUN specific changes to 
-- the following files:

-- Now, if you are on the "loadup" machine, exit medley and go to another
-- machine.  RLOGIN to the loadup machine and do the following:

-- Build an init-specific lde note: you must have a directory under
-- the maiko directory called init.ARCH where ARCH is the architecture 
-- of the machine you will run the lde on.  On a sun4, it would be init.sparc.

cd ~/maiko/bin
makeinitlde -e

-- connect back to your home directory and make a link to the lde and
-- ldeether (fill in yourname and machine os and arch in the proper
-- slots below

cd ~
ln -s /users/YOURNAME/maiko/init.ARCH/lde
ln -s /users/YOURNAME/maiko/init.ARCH/ldeether

-- make sure you don't have LDEDESTSYSOUT set as you want the sysout on your home
-- directory.

-- You will need dbxinit.txt available

-- YOU MUST USE A FRESH COPY OF XREM.CM EVERY TIME YOU TRY THIS AS IT
-- GETS SMASHED AT STARTUP

cp ~/XREM.CM ~/REM.CM

-- start lde under dbx

-- init lde can't treat 'LDEDESTSYSOUT'
unsetenv LDEDESTSYSOUT

dbx lde

-- load the dbxinit

source /users/maiko/working/bin/dbxinit.txt

-- now set up to stop on error (before URAID, which loses 'cause 
-- it can't find the keyboard.)

err

run ~/INIT.DLINIT -INIT -NF

-- this is going to run and eventually log itself out.  when dbx returns, quit
-- from dbx and presto! You've built the beginnings of a loadup.

---

-- go to the loadup machine and connect to the place where you normally
-- get your lde from

cd ~/maiko/sunos4.sparc/

-- Get the new REM.CM: (YOU MUST DO THIS EVERYTIME AS
-- REM.CM gets wasted on startup!!)

cp ~/LOADUP-REM.CM ~/REM.CM
ldeether

-- Now this is going to march happily through loading files.  When it turns
-- on the windowworld, you may have to hit the space bar to make it continue.

-- I don't know how to make PUP and LEAF load at this point, but I'm working 
-- on it.

-- I am also working on integrating the changes to the emulator with the latest
-- stuff.

-- closure caching is still off.

-- Questions or comments?
