Then if CONFIRMFLG is non-NIL and the key was not completed via a confirming character (case 3 and 4 above) askuser waits for a confirming character.  --- --- After confirmation, if KEYLST is non NIL, askuser descends into KEYLST.  Otherwise askuser returns a value which is the value of (eval of) the RETURN field, if non-NIL, otherwise the result of packing all the keys or keystrings, if present --- see below on the path.  --- At any point, the user can type an alt-mode which is equivalent to typing the next n shared characters.  (if there are none, a bell is rung.) Typing a confirming character has the same effect as typing an alt-mode, i.e.  the next n shared characters will be supplied.  If the key is the only key left, confirmation is not required.  (this is case 4 above).  If the key is not the only key left, a bell is rung.  --- --- special options: --- EXPLAINSTRING if non-nil, used in place of key/keystring + promptstring when user types a ?  --- NOECHOFLG if non-nil, characters that are matched are not echoed --- KEYSTRING if non-nil, characters that are matched are echoed from keystring.  The main reason for this feature echoing, since ASKUSER converts everything to a canonical upper case form, keys will always be represented in uppercase.  KEYSTRING can be used to provide for lower case echoing, and for returning a lower case value.  i.e.  if the RETURN option is not specified, and KEYSTRING is specified, then KEYSTRING will be used in constructing the value to be returned, rather than KEY.  --- PROMPTON if non-NIL, PROMPTSTRING is printed only when the key is confirmed with a member of PROMPTON.  This feature is used for implementing TENEX protocols, in which case PROMPTON would be ($) Note that this doesnt make much sense unless CONFIRMFLG is also non-NIL and includes the elements on PROMPTON --- --- COMPLETEON when a confirming character is typed, the n characters that are supplied are not echoed unless the confirming charactter is a member of COMPLETEON.  This is used for implementing tenex protocols in which case COMPLETEON is ($), i.e.  user could complete a command with space or c.r.  but completion and prompting would take place only for $ --- --- AUTOCOMPLETEFLG if T, says supply characters as soon as they are unambiguous, i.e.  act as though alt-mode were typed after each character (but dont ring a bell) --- MACROCHARS, a list of characters and forms.  if one of the characters is typed, and doesnt match as a key, then the form is evaluated for effect and everything else stays the same, e.g.  ?  could have been implemented this way.  this feature is probably most useful when MACROCHARS is supplied on OPTIONSLST since one probably wants a global set of MACROCHARS for a call single call to askuser.  --- --- & as a key matches any character.  --- --- '' can be used as a key It starts out with all of its characters matched, so that it is complete if it is the only key left, (1) above, or the next character mtches one of the keys on its KEYLST, etc.  --- --- $ can be used as a key to match the result of doing a READ.  For example, the filepkg has as one of its entries on its keylst ('' 'file/list: ' KEYLST ($)) which means that if a character is typpd that does not match any of the other charactters on its keylst, the prompt message file/list: is printed, and a read is then performed and eturned as the value of the call to askuser.  --- --- --- For the more common useage, KEY is the same as (KEY NIL CONFIRMFLG T), and (KEY  .
