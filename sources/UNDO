Undoing out of order is defined as restoring any cells changed in the indicated operation to their original state before the operation was performed. For independent operations, undoing will have the correct effect. However, for dependent operations, it may have an unforeseen effect. For example, ATTACH (A X) ATTACH (B X) followed by UNDO A will remove both A and B since the cell changed by the first ATTACH was the first cell in X, and this will be restored to its former state. In general, operations are always independent if they affect different lists or different sublists (not TAILS) of the same list. However, because property list functions might be thought of as independent, PUT, REMPROP, and ADDPROP are treated specially. Thus put (FOO PROP1 VAL1) followed by PUTPROP (FOO PROP2 VAL2) followed by UNDO PROP1 will remove just PROP1 even if both PUT'S resulted in new properties and hence additions to the end of the property list.)
