Lyric Manual Test proceduresFiled as: {Eris}<Test>Admin>ManualManual.teditThis document is a part of the procedures describing how to run tests on the Xerox Lisp Environment.  The following is a list of the tests that must be run by hand.  These are of two types.  1. Those that are run via the do-test software and thus automatically log errors.  These are denoted by a .u extention.  2. Those that must be manually logged.Running interactive regression tests using do-test1. Bring up the LISP.SYSOUT to be tested.2. In an XCL executive window, load DO-TEST by typing (LOAD "{ERIS}<LISPCORE>INTERNAL>LIBRARY>DO-TEST.DFASL")3. To run tests using DO-TEST, type (DO-ALL-TESTS :PATTERNS '("filenames") :RESULTS "{Eris}<Test>SubSystemName>SubsystemName.log")For example, to run all the interactive tests for the debugger and put the results in a file named debugger.log, do the following:(DO-ALL-TESTS	:PATTERNS '("{Eris}<Test>Env>Debugger>Hand>*.u;")	:RESULTS "{Eris}<Test>Env>Debugger>Logs>Debugger.log")Note the importance of using the terminating semicolon on test file names.  Not supplying the semicolon makes it run all versions of that file name!See {eris}<lispcore>internal>library>do-test.tedit for the full list of features.Helpful utilities:(IL:FILESLOAD WHO-LINE) ;each field is active to help change them.(IL:FILESLOAD FILEWATCH) ;use background menu to turn on a monitor of what files you have openSUCCESS / FAILURE prompt windowsSome tests will pop up a prompt window requesting certain actions and to look for certain results.  At the top of the window are the words SUCCESS and FAILURE.  If the results of the test are as prompted, select SUCCESS otherwise select FAILURE.  You may move and shrink this window, but do not close it.Before this window is popped up, you will be asked if you want a SHORT, MEDIUM, or LONG test and you will be presented with a menu.  A short test will only test high priority items.  LONG will test all cases.Reporting resultsAfter running a test for a subsystem, shift-select the log file into a message and address it to: John Sybalsky, the appropriate developer, and the test writer.Here is a lafite-form for this purpose:Subject: Test results for >>subsystem name<<To:  >>developer<<, >>test writer<<, >>documenter<<cc:  Sybalsky.pa>> test log <<LIST OF MODULES TO BE TESTED:EXEC - Tests written by John Park  Location of Old Detailed Test Procedures: {eris}<test>env>exec>hand>test.proc Approximate time to run test: < 1 hr.  Note: You cannot use do-all-tests with the Exec test suite.  You must instead:(DO-TEST-FILE '{Eris}<Test>Env>exec>Hand>FOO.u)where FOO is the name of each .u file in the directory.These are automatic tests, which feed the input into exec via bksysbuf.  Test results are automatically logged in {eris}<lispcore>test>exec>test.report, but you must make sure a new version of the file exists before you run the tests.  Be sure the exec is in the XCL-TEST package.  While running these tests you must not place the caret outside of the exec or do any other work while the tests are running.  1108 Regression tests assigned to Norm Schuster, 3/18/87.DEBUGGER - Tests written by Kirk Kelley  Relevant developer: Andy Daniels(DO-ALL-TESTS	:PATTERNS '("{Eris}<Test>Env>Debugger>Hand>*.u;")	:RESULTS "{Eris}<Test>Env>Debugger>Logs>Debugger.log") Approximate time to run test: < 1 hr. Note: These are a mixture of automatic tests and those that require interaction. Some of them intentially pop up break windows since this tests break windows.  If in the process of testing you get a break window that is not obviously part of the test, uparrow out of it (type an ^ or use the one from the title menu) and the next test should appear.These tests were generated (and run) on an 1108.Regression tests assigned to Masa Tateno, 3/18/87.DEDIT - Tests written by Henry Cate   Location of test file: {eris}<test>env>DEdit>hand>*.u   Location of log file: {eris}<test>env>DEdit>logs>DEdit.log   Approximate time to run test: < 1 hr.1108 Regression tests assigned to Albert Sahim, 3/18/87.DISPLAY - Tests written by Peter ReidyLocation of test procedure: {eris}<test>i/o>display>hand>cursor.procLocation of test source code (used by both cursor.proc and cursor.test: {eris}<test>i/o>display>hand>cursor.test   Location of log file: {eris}<test>i/o>display>logs>cursor.logHARDCOPY - Tests written by Peter Reidy  Location of test plans: {erinyes}<test>lisp>lyric>plans>fx80driver.plan, 4045xlpstream.plan, press/interpress.plan  Location of test procedure files: {eris}<test>i/o>hardcopy>hand>fx80driver.proc, 4045xlpstream.proc, press/interpress.proc  Location of log files: {eris}<test>i/o>hardcopy>hand>fx80driver.log, 4045xlpstream.log, press/interpress.log  Location of test code: {eris}<test>i/o>hardcopy>hand>streamtests.u  Location of test cases: {eris}<lispcore>test>streams>Regression tests assigned to >>NAME<<, >>DATE<<.KEYBOARD - Tests written by Henry Cate   Location of test file: {eris}<test>i/o>Keyboard>hand>*.u				(As of march 10th, there are 4 tests.)   Location of log file: {eris}<test>i/o>Keyboard>logs>Keyboard.log   Approximate time to run test: about 15 minutes.Regression tests assigned to Albert Sahim, 3/26/87.PROGRAM ANALYSIS  - Tests written by John Park(Subsystems: Masterscope, Databasefns, Browser, Spy, and Inspector)Masterscope  Location of test files: {eris}<test>env>program-analysis>hand>masterscope.u   Location of log file: {eris}<test>env>program-analysis>logs>masterscope.report Approximate time to run test:  7 minutes.Databasefns  Location of test files: {eris}<test>env>program-analysis>hand>databasefns.u   Location of log file: {eris}<test>env>program-analysis>logs>databasefns.report Approximate time to run test:  3 minutes. Note: The data file used by this test is in {eris}<test>env>program-analysis>hand>databasefns.dataBrowser  Location of test files: {eris}<test>env>program-analysis>hand>browser-part1.u 			{eris}<test>env>program-analysis>hand>browser-part2.u  Location of log file: {eris}<test>env>program-analysis>logs>browser.report Approximate time to run test:  8 minutes. Note:  There are two test files for browser testing.
