;; Syntax:        FORGET  &rest EVENT-SPEC
;;
;; Function Description: Erase UNDO information for the specified events. 
;; 
;; Argument(s):  EVENT-SPEC
;;			  
;; Returns:     See function description
;;
;; Constraints/Limitations: Due to the nature of Programmer's Assistant commands,
;; testing them will not be totally automatic.  Comments are incorporated within 
;; each command file, which will be run by using the function bksysbuf.  
;; Each test setup is titled "COMMAND-TEST-SETUP", which executes the command 
;; string. The do-test form within the command file will return T or "test 
;; failed" This test file requires TEDIT package.  
;;
;;
;; Messages will be printed before each command in the command files is executed
;; for user monitoring.   Test result is logged on 
;; {eris}<lispcore>test>exec>test.report.
