;; Syntax:        REMEMBER &REST EVENT-SPEC
;;
;; Function Description: Tell History list manager to remember type-in from
;; specified event(s)
;; 
;; Argument(s):  Event-Spec
;;			  
;; Returns:     See function description
;; Constraints/Limitations: Due to the nature of Programmer's Assistant commands,
;; testing them willbe accomplished by using the interlisp function bksysbuf 
;; in do-test form.  Comments are incorporated within  each command file. 
;; The do-test test setup is titled "REMEMBER-TEST-SETUP", which executes the command 
;; string. The do-test form within the command file will return T or "test "quote" 
;; failed in file "unknown". " This test file requires TEDIT package.  
;; The test result will be logged automatically in the following file:
;; {ERIS}<lispcore>test>exec>test.report
;;
;; Messages will be printed before each command in the command files is executed
;; for user monitoring. This test will determine whether the specified event for
;; REMEMBER is "remembered".  Test result is logged on 
;; {eris}<lispcore>test>exec>test.report.
