;; Syntax:      (BROWSER T/NIL)
;;
;; Function Description: BROWSER modifies the SHOW PATHS command of Masterscope so that 
;; the command's output is displayed as an undirected graph.  It creates a new window
;; for each SHOW PATHS command, but will reuse a window if that window has an earlier
;; instance of the same SHOW PATHS command displayed in it.
;; 
;; Argument(s):  T or NIL (SEE Browser documentation)
;;			  
;; Returns:    IL:MSPATHS  
;;
;; Constraints/Limitations: BROWSER modifies the SHOW PATHS command of Masterscope so that 
;; the command's output is displayed as an undirected graph.  It creates a new window
;; for each SHOW PATHS command, but will reuse a window if that window has an earlier
;; instance of the same SHOW PATHS command displayed in it.  Part 1 of this test is 
;; to determine if masterscope is unaffected when the BROWSER is not enabled or 
;; (IL:BROWSER NIL). Part I also tests to see if grapher is automatically loaded
;; by browser. Make sure that Part 1 is run before Part 2.  Part 2 of BROWSER test 
;; determines if BROWSER modified masterscope in such a way that paths are displayed
;; grahically in a display window.
;;
;; The tree structure of the functions being analyzed are as follows:
;;
;;				  Top-GFuntion
;;					  |
;;	      GFun-A------------------------GFun-B
;;		  |						|
;;    ---------------------              --------------------
;;    |		  |	      |			|         |	    |
;;  GFun-A1  GFun-A2  GFun-A3	  	 GFun-B1	 GFun-B2	  GFun-B3
;;						     	   |
;;					    	  --------------
;;					   	  |		     |
;;				     	   GFun-C1	       GFun-A1
;;

;; Messages will be printed before each command in the command files is executed
;; for user monitoring.   Test result is logged on
