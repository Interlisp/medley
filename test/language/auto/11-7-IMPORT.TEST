;; Syntax:        (import symbols &optional package)
;;
;; Function Description: The argument should be a list of symbols, or possibly
;; a single symbol.  These symbols become internal symbols in package and can
;; therefore be referred to without having to use qualified-name (colon) syntax.
;; import signals a correctable error if any of the imported symbols has the same
;; name as some distinct symbol already accessible in the package.  Import returns T.
;; 
;; Argument(s):  Symbol(s)
;;			 Package (optional)
;;			  
;; Returns:     T
;;
;; Constraints/Limitations: none
