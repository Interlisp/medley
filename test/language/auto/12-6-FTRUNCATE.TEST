;; Syntax:        (FTRUNCATE NUMBER &OPTIONAL DIVISOR)
;;
;; Function Description:
;; These functions are just like FLOOR, CEILING, TRUNCATE, and
;; ROUND, except that the result (the first result of two) is always a
;; floating-point number rather than an integer.  It is roughly as if
;; FFLOOR gave its arguments to FLOOR, and then applied FLOAT to
;; the first result before passing them both back.  In practice, however,
;; FFLOOR may be implemented much more efficiently.  Similar remarks
;; apply to the other three functions.  If the first argument is a
;; floating-point number, and the second argument is not a floating-point
;; number of shorter format, then the first result will be a floating-point
;; number of the same type as the first argument.
;; For example:
;; 
;;     (FFLOOR -4.7) => -5.0 AND 0.3
;;     (FFLOOR 3.5D0) => 3.0D0 AND 0.5D0
;;     
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; Argument(s):   NUMBER - a number
;;                DIVISOR - a real
;;
;; Returns:       a number
