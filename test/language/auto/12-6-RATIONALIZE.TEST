;; Syntax:        (RATIONALIZE NUMBER)
;;
;; Function Description:
;; Each of these functions converts any non-complex number to be a rational
;; number.  If the argument is already rational, it is returned.
;; The two functions differ in their treatment of floating-point numbers.
;; 
;; RATIONAL assumes that the floating-point number is completely accurate
;; and returns a rational number mathematically equal to the precise
;; value of the floating-point number.
;; 
;; RATIONALIZE assumes that the
;; floating-point number is accurate only to the precision of the
;; floating-point representation, and may return any rational number for
;; which the floating-point number is the best available approximation of
;; its format; in doing this it attempts to keep both numerator and
;; denominator small.
;; 
;; It is always the case that
;; 
;;     (FLOAT (RATIONAL X) X) = X
;;     
;; and
;; 
;;     (FLOAT (RATIONALIZE X) X) = X
;;     
;; That is, rationalizing a floating-point number by either method
;; and then converting it back
;; to a floating-point number of the same format produces the original number.
;; What distinguishes the two functions is that RATIONAL typically
;; has a simple, inexpensive implementation, whereas RATIONALIZE goes
;; to more trouble to produce a result that is more pleasant to view and
;; simpler for some purposes to compute with.
;; 
;; Argument(s):   NUMBER - a number
;;
;; Returns:       a number
