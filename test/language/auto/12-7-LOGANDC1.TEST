;; Syntax:        (LOGANDC1 INTEGER1 INTEGER2)
;;
;; Function Description:
;; These are the other six non-trivial bit-wise logical operations
;; on two arguments.  Because they are not associative,
;; they take exactly two arguments rather than any non-negative number
;; of arguments.
;; 
;;     
;;     (LOGNAND N1 N2) =          (LOGNOT (LOGAND N1 N2))
;;     (LOGNOR N1 N2) =          (LOGNOT (LOGIOR N1 N2))
;;     (LOGANDC1 N1 N2) =          (LOGAND (LOGNOT N1) N2)
;;     (LOGANDC2 N1 N2) =          (LOGAND N1 (LOGNOT N2))
;;     (LOGIORC1 N1 N2) =          (LOGIOR (LOGNOT N1) N2)
;;     (LOGIORC2 N1 N2) =          (LOGIOR N1 (LOGNOT N2))
;;     
;; 
;; Argument(s):   INTEGER1 - an integer
;;                INTEGER2 - an integer
;;
;; Returns:       a number
