;; Last Update: 8 October 86 - change plusp to not minusp and remove an implementation-dependent test.

;; Filed As:      {eris}<lispcore>cml>test>13-1-character-attributes.test
;;
;; Test Description: See that the constants are defined and that they are non-negative; see that char-bits-limit is a power of 2.
