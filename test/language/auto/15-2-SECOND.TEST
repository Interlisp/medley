;; Note that the ordinal numbering used here is one-origin,
;; as opposed to the zero-origin numbering used by function NTH:
;; 
;;     (FIFTH X) = (NTH 4 X)
;;     
;; 
;; macro SETF may be used with each of these functions to store
;; into the indicated position of a list.
;; 
;; Argument(s):   LIST - a list
;;
