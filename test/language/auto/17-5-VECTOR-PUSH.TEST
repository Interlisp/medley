;; Syntax: vector-push new-element vector
;;
;; Function Description: Vector-push stores new-element in the vector specified 
;; by the fill-pointer, which is incremented by 1 afterwards.  If the 
;; fill-pointer is t (i.e. size of a vector) or is incremented to the size of a
;; vector, nil will be returned.
