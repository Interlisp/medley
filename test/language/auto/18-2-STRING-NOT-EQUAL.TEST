;; Syntax:  string-not-equal string1 string2 &key :start1 :end1 :start2 :end2              
;;
;; Function Description: The function compares the respective strings (with the keywords for the respective strings counting from 0 and the :end keywords designating the character after the last compared) lexicographically (i.e. it compares the corresponding characters by the function char-not-equal).  Comparison is case-insensitive.
;;
;; Argument(s):	string1, string2: character strings
;;			:start1, start2: the start-comparison position in the respective strings (counting from 0)
;;			:end1, end2: the last character + 1 (counting from 0) to compare - i.e. if comparing "string" with a :end keyword of 4, the last character compared will be the letter i.				        	
;;
;; Returns:	If all characters satisfy char/=: the index (counting from 0) of the first non-identical character - i.e. the length of the portion of the strings that satisfies the predicate.
;;			If not: nil
