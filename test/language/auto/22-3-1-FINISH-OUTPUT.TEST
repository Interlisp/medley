;; Syntax: finish-output &optional output-stream               
;;
;; Function Description: The function finish-output attempts to ensure that all output sent to output-stream has reached its destination, and only then returns nil.  force-output initiates the emptying of any internal buffers but returns nil without waiting for completion or acknowledgment.  The function clear-output, on the other hand, attempts to abort any outstanding output operation in progress in order to allow as little output as possible to continue to the desitnation.
;;
;; Argument(s):  output-stream
;;
;; Returns: nil
;;
;; These tests just test that the functions dont break for a variety of devices.  It could be improved by putting out a huge string or simulating a slow channel by advising \bufferedbout (whatever its called) and do some elapsed time tests after each type of output.  Then do an input-test to see if all the characters made it (or not in the case of clear-output).
