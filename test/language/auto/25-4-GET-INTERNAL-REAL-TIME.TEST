;; Syntax:        (get-internal-real-time)
;;
;; Function Description: This function  returns the current real time in Internal
;; Time Format. This time is relative to an arbitrary time base, but the difference
;; between the values of two calls to this function will be the amount of elapsed
;; real time between the two calls measured in the units defined by 
;; internal-time-units-per-second. 
;;
;; Argument(s):  none
;;			  
;; Returns: Integer  
;;
;; Constraints/Limitations: none
