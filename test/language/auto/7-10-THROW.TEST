;; Syntax:                throw TAG RESULT
;;
;; Function Description:  The throw special form transfers control to a matching catch construct.  The TAG is evaluated first to 
;;					produce an object called the throw tag ; then the RESULT form is evaluated, and its results are saved.
;;					The most recent outstanding catch whose tag matches the throw tag is exited ; the saved results are
;;					returned as the value(s) of the catch.
;;
;; Argument(s):          TAG     - a lisp form (which returns a symbol)
;;					RESULT - a lisp form
;; Returns:               anything    
;;
