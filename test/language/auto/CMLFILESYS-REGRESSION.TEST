(do-test "file-author should return NIL when author is unknown"
	(let ((strm (open "{nodircore}foo" :direction :output)))
		(prog1 (not (file-author strm))
			(close strm))))

(do-test "file-position should return a number when passed just a stream"
	(let ((strm (open "{nodircore}foo" :direction :output)))
		(prog1 (file-position strm)
			(close strm))))
