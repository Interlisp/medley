This directory was taken from python. it originally came from Erinyes
but I believe that Frank Shih created its subdirectories to better
be able to run the testsuites without hitting several limitations that
Unix will run into when dealing with directories with A LOT OF files.

This is of course pure guess work, but he seems to have organized the 
subdirectories according to chapter?
