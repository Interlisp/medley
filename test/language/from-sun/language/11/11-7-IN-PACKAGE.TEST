;; Syntax:        (in-package package-name &key :nicknames :use)
;;
;; Function Description: This function is intended to be placed at the start of a 
;; file containing a subsystem that is to be loaded into some package other than 
;; USER.  If there is not already a package with the specified name, one is created
;; as with make-package.  If there is an existing package, it is augumented to
;; reflect any new nicknames or used packages.
;;  
;; 
;; Argument(s):   package-name: string or symbol
;;			 nicknames (key): list of string(s)
;;			use: list of string(s) or symbol(s)
;;			  
;;			  
;; Returns:      package-name or nil
;;
;; Constraints/Limitations: This file may be similar to other files that test 
;; package  functions as a file may use the following or combinations of the 
;; following forms:
;;				(provide ...)
;;				(in-package...)
;;				(shadow...)
;;				(export...)
;;				(require...)
;;				(use-package...)
;;				(import...)
