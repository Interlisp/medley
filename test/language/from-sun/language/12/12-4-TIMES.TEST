;; Syntax:        (* &REST NUMBERS)
;;
;; Function Description:
;; This returns the product of the arguments.
;; If there are no arguments, the result
;; is 1, which is an identity for this operation.
;; 
;; Compatibility note: While * is compatible with its use in Zetalisp,
;; it is incompatible with Maclisp, which uses * for fixnum-only
;; multiplication.
;; 
;; Argument(s):   NUMBERS - numbers
;;
;; Returns:       a number
