;; Syntax:        (DENOMINATOR RATIONAL)
;;
;; Function Description:
;; These functions take a rational number (an integer or ratio)
;; and return as an integer the numerator or denominator of the canonical
;; reduced form of the rational.  The numerator of an integer is that integer,
;; and the denominator of an integer is 1.  Note that
;; 
;;     (GCD (NUMERATOR X) (DENOMINATOR X)) => 1
;;     
;; The denominator will always be a strictly positive integer;
;; the numerator may be any integer.
;; For example:
;; 
;;     (NUMERATOR (/ 8 -6)) => -4
;;     (DENOMINATOR (/ 8 -6)) => 3
;;     
;; 
;; Argument(s):   RATIONAL - a rational
;;
;; Returns:       a positive integer
