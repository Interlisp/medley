;; Syntax:        (FLOAT NUMBER &OPTIONAL OTHER)
;;
;; Function Description:
;; This converts any non-complex number to a floating-point number.
;; With no second argument, if NUMBER is already a floating-point
;; number, then NUMBER is returned;
;; otherwise a SINGLE-FLOAT is produced.
;; If the argument OTHER is provided, then it must be a floating-point
;; number, and NUMBER is converted to the same format as OTHER.
;; See also function COERCE.
;; 
;; Argument(s):   NUMBER - a real
;;                OTHER - a floating point number
;;
;; Returns:       a floating point number
