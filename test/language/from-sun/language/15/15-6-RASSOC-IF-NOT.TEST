;; Syntax:        (RASSOC-IF-NOT PREDICATE ALIST)
;;
;; Function Description:
;; RASSOC is the reverse form of ASSOC; it searches for
;; a pair whose CDR satisfies the test, rather than the CAR.
;; If the A-LIST is considered to be a mapping, then RASSOC
;; treats the A-LIST as representing the inverse mapping.
;; For example:
;; 
;;     (RASSOC 'A '((A . B) (B . C) (C . A) (Z . A))) => (C . A)
;;     
;; 
;; The expressions
;; 
;;     (RASSOC ITEM LIST :TEST FN)
;;     
;; and
;; 
;;     (FIND ITEM LIST :TEST FN :KEY #'CDR)
;;     
;; are equivalent in meaning, except when the ITEM is NIL
;; and NIL appears in place of a pair in the a-list.  See the discussion
;; of the function function ASSOC.
;; 
;; Argument(s):   PREDICATE - a function
;;                ALIST - an association list
;;
;; Returns:       a list
