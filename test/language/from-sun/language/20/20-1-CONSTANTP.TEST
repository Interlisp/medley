;; Syntax:        (constantp object)
;;
;; Function Description: If the predicate constantp is true of an object, then 
;; that object, when considered as a form to be evaluated, always evaluates to
;; the same thing; it is a constant.  This includes self-evaluating objects
;; such as numbers, characters, strings, bit-vectors, and keywords, as well as
;; all constant symbols declared by defconstant, such as nil t and pi.  
;; In addition, a list whose car is quote, such as (quote foo), is considered 
;; to be constant.  
;;
;; Argument(s): object
;;			  
;; Returns: T or NIL    
;;
;; Constraints/Limitations:



(do-test "constantp-test1"
		(and (constantp NIL)
			(constantp T)
			(constantp pi)
			(constantp *evalhook*)
			(constantp most-positive-double-float)
			(constantp "STRING")
