;; Syntax:        (ecase keyform {({({key}*)|key} {form}*)}*
;;
;; Function Description: This control construct is similar to case, but no explicit
;; otherwise or T clause is permitted.  If no clause is satisfied, ecase signals
;; an error with a message constructed from the clauses.  It is not permissible to
;; continue from this error.  The name of this function stands for "exhaustive
;; case" or "error-checking case."
;;
;; Argument(s): Keyplace: Key (variable)
;;			(type {form}): type case for error checking
;;			  
;; Returns:      
;;
;; Constraints/Limitations: Due to the nature of ecase function, which enters
;; the debugger (break), this test should be conducted manually to see if correct 
;; error messages are returned.  Tests requiring user interface are commented out.
