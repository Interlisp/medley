;; Syntax:        (ed &optional x)
;;
;; Function Description: If the implementation provides a resident editor, this function
;; should invoke it.  (ed) or (ed nil) simply enters the editor, leaving one in the same
;; state as the last time he was in the editor.  (ed pathname) edits the contents of the
;; file specified by pathname.  The pathname may be an actual pathname or a string.
;; (ed symbol) tries to let you edit the text for the function named symbol.
;;
;; Argument(s): nil, pathname, or symbol
;;			  
;; Returns: 
;;
;; Constraints/Limitations: This function requires user-interface so it's not realistic
;; to run this test automatically.  This test merely tests to see if there is a global
;; function definition for ed, which does not necessarily mean it has met the require-
;; ments prescribed in CLtL.  This will require manual testing.
