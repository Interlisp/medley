;;
;;
;; Syntax:        (inspect object)
;;
;; Function Description: Inspect is an interactive version of describe.  The nature 
;; of the interaction is implementation-dependent, but the purpose of inspect is to 
;; make it easy to wander through a data structure, examining and modifying parts
;; of it. Implementations are encouraged to respond to the typing of the character ?
;; by providing help, including a list of commands. 
;;
;; Argument(s): object
;;			  
;; Returns: process (i.e #<PROCESS @ 51,123400>)
;;
;; Constraints/Limitations: This function requires user-interface so it's not 
;; realistic to run this test automatically.  This test merely tests to see if 
;; there is a global function definition for inspect, which does not necessarily 
;; mean it has met the requirements prescribed in CLtL.  This will require
;; manual testing.
