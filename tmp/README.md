## Temporary Build directory for Medley

Loadups get built here. If you're working from a release or your
making your own loadup, it's OK to blow away the contents
of this directory, but some scripts might break if the directory isn't here.
Checking in a file makes the directory in an otherwise clean new clone.

(see ../BUILDING.md and ./clhs/README.md)
