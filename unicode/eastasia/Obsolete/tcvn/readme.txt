"TCVN-NSCII Stack 1.0" README
 --------------------

The accompanying file  TCV-SEA.HQX is a BinHex'd
self-extracting archive of a Macintosh HyperCard 2.1 stack. After
retrieving the file, convert it from BinHex with any of the popular Mac
archiving utilities (such as CompactPro or Stuffit), and execute the
resulting application to extract the stack.

The stack consists of 2357 cards (about 1.2Meg), which correspond to
the Nom proper characters documented in the new 16-bit Vietnamese
national character standard  TCVN-5773:1993 (NSCII - Nom Standard Code
for Information Interchange)  for the Vietnamese Han-based Nom script.
TCVN-5773 adopts the ISO 10646-1:1993 (UCS) BMP as its base, and
defines 1775 additional Nom characters extracted from "Tu dien chu Nom"
["Nom Dictionary"] by Nguyen Quang Xy and Vu Van Kinh (Saigon, 1971).

Each card in the stack shows the Nom glyph, the corresponding Quoc ngu
(Latin) spelling, and character codes. The code value of any Nom proper
character already defined in ISO 10646/Unicode is prefixed with "U+",
otherwise "V+" is used; further cross-references to other CJKV code
standards are displayed where available. The Latin spelling is encoded
in 8-bit TCVN-5712:1993 (VSCII).
