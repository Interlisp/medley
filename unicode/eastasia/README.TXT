EASTASIA:
	The CDROM came with CJK cross reference mappings for standards such as KSC5601,
	GB2312, JIS0208, etc. to Unicode 2.0.
	However, these particular mappings are now obsolete and have been removed as per
	this note from Unicode.org:
	   The entire former contents of this directory are obsolete and have been
       moved to the OBSOLETE directory.  The latest information may be found
       in the Unihan data files in the latest Unicode Character Database.
       August 1, 2001.
    The current set of mappings are available from 
           https://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Unihan.zip
    The format of these files is given in https://unicode.org/reports/tr38/
