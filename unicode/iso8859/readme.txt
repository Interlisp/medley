8859 to Unicode mapping tables.

December 2, 2015

These tables are considered to be authoritative mappings
between the Unicode Standard and different parts of
the ISO/IEC 8859 standard.

Mappings between these standards are done on the basis
of the character names and UCS identifications published
in each part of ISO/IEC 8859, in the revised editions
of each part of the standard.

In cases where prior mappings to ISO/IEC 8859 differed in
some substantial way from the most recent mapping, or where
characters have been added to a part of ISO/IEC 8859, earlier
versions are archived in the DatedVersions directory, with
the relevant year of the published part of ISO/IEC 8859
as part of the mapping table filename, to indicate which
edition the mapping was intended for. The archived mappings
tables can be used to verify mappings which may have been
implemented in earlier versions of software.

Note that some of the older tables internally refer to an
out-of-date mechanism for reporting errors, using an "errata"
email address that is no longer in service. Any errors
should instead be reported using the Unicode Consortium's
reporting form:
