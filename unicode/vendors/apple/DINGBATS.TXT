#   Apple, the Apple logo, and Macintosh are trademarks of Apple
#   Computer, Inc., registered in the United States and other countries.
#   Unicode is a trademark of Unicode Inc. For the sake of brevity,
#   throughout this document, "Macintosh" can be used to refer to
#   Macintosh computers and "Unicode" can be used to refer to the
#   Unicode standard.
#
#   Apple Computer, Inc. ("Apple") makes no warranty or representation,

#
#   These mapping tables and character lists are subject to change.
#   The latest tables should be available from the following:
#
#   <http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/APPLE/>
#
#   For general information about Mac OS encodings and these mapping
#   tables, see the file "README.TXT".
#
# Format:
# -------
#
#   Three tab-separated columns;
#   '#' begins a comment which continues to the end of the line.
#     Column #1 is the Mac OS Dingbats code (in hex as 0xNN)
#     Column #2 is the corresponding Unicode or Unicode sequence
#       (in hex as 0xNNNN).
#     Column #3 is a comment containing the Unicode name.
#       In some cases an additional comment follows the Unicode name.
#
#   The entries are in Mac OS Dingbats code order.
#
#   Some of these mappings require the use of corporate characters.
#   See the file "CORPCHAR.TXT" and notes below.
#
#   Control character mappings are not shown in this table, following
#   the conventions of the standard UTC mapping tables. However, the
#   Mac OS Dingbats character set uses the standard control characters
#   at 0x00-0x1F and 0x7F.
#
# Notes on Mac OS Dingbats:
# -------------------------
#
#   This is a legacy Mac OS encoding; in the Mac OS X Carbon and Cocoa
#   environments, it is only supported directly in programming
#   interfaces for QuickDraw Text, the Script Manager, and related
#   Text Utilities. For other purposes it is supported via transcoding
#   to and from Unicode.
#
#   The Mac OS Dingbats encoding shares the script code smRoman
#   (0) with the standard Mac OS Roman encoding. To determine if
#   the Dingbats encoding is being used, you must check if the
#   font name is "Zapf Dingbats".
#
#   The layout of the Dingbats character set is identical to or
#   a superset of the layout of the Adobe Zapf Dingbats encoding
#   vector.
#
#   The following code points are unused, and are not shown here:
#   0x8E-0xA0, 0xF0, 0xFF.
#
# Unicode mapping issues and notes:
# ---------------------------------
#
# Details of mapping changes in each version:
# -------------------------------------------
#
#   Changes from version b02 to version b03/c01:
#
#   - The mappings for the following Mac OS Dingbats characters
#   were changed to use standard Unicode characters added for
#   Unicode 3.2: 0x80-0x8D.
#
#   Changes from version n03 to version n05:
#
#   - The mappings for the following Mac OS Dingbats characters
#   were changed from single corporate-zone Unicode characters
#   to standard Unicode characters:
#   0x80-0x81, 0x84-0x87, 0x8A-0x8D.
#
#   - The mappings for the following Mac OS Dingbats characters
#   were changed from single corporate-zone Unicode characters
#   to combinations of a standard Unicode and a transcoding hint:
#   0x82-0x83, 0x88-0x89.
