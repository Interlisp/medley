#
# Notes on Mac OS Ukrainian and Mac OS Cyrillic:
# ----------------------------------------------
#
#   Before Mac OS 9.0, there were two separate Slavic Cyrillic
#   encodings for the Mac OS:
#
#   1. The Cyrillic currency sign variant (used for localized Russian
#      and Bulgarian systems), which had the following:
#	    0xA2  U+00A2 CENT SIGN
#	    0xB6  U+2202 PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL
#	    0xFF  U+00A4 CURRENCY SIGN
#
#   2. The Ukrainian currency sign variant (used for localized Ukrainian
#      systems and the pre-9.0 Cyrillic Language Kit), which had the
#      following:
#	    0xA2  U+0490 CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER GHE WITH UPTURN
#	    0xB6  U+0491 CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER GHE WITH UPTURN
#	    0xFF  U+00A4 CURRENCY SIGN
#
#   Before Mac OS 9.0, The Ukrainian currency sign variant shared the
#   script code smCyrillic (7) with the Cyrillic currency sign variant. 
#   The Ukrainian currency sign variant was being used if one of the
#   following was true:
#   - The system region code was 62, verUkraine (indicates Ukrainian
#     localized system), or
#   - The system script was not 7, smCyrillic (indicates Cyrillic
#     Language Kit instead of localized system).
#
#   For Mac OS 9.0 and later, both currency sign variants were replaced
#   with a new Euro sign version of Mac OS Cyrillic, which is similar to
#   the old Ukrainian currency sign variant but changes 0xFF to EURO
#   SIGN. Mappings for this are in CYRILLIC.TXT.
#
#   Note: There is a common glyph variation in Ukrainian, in which the
#   glyph for CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER BYELORUSSIAN-UKRAINIAN I may or
#   may not have a dot above.
#
# Details of mapping changes in each version:
# -------------------------------------------
#
#   Changes from version n04 to version b02:
#
#   - Encoding changed for Mac OS 9.0 to merge with Mac OS Cyrillic and
#   support EURO SIGN; 0xFF changed from U+00A4 to U+20AC. For Mac OS
#   9.0 there is no longer a separate Mac OS Ukrainian character set, so
#   the mappings here are deleted; see the mappings in CYRILLIC.TXT.
