IBM Conversion Mapping Tables

IBM has a repository of character data mapping tables between
many different character encodings and Unicode. The mapping of
some characters in the IBM conversion tables may vary from those of
other vendors. These differences may be due to differences in
interpretation of international or country standards. They may
also be due to historical product or platform preferences. IBM
conversion tables are available from a number of sources.

Unicode mappings can be found in the http://site.icu-project.org/International
Components\ for\ Unicode\ (ICU) which is a mature, portable set
of C/C++ and Java libraries for Unicode support, software
internationalization (I18N) and globalization (G11N), giving
applications the same results on all platforms.

Additionally, IBM has the https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/G01BQVRV>Character\
Data\ Representation\ Architecture (CDRA) which defines a set of
identifiers and supporting resources for data identification and
conversion. The CDRA conversion table resources can be obtained
from https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/java/downloads.jsp>IBM
developerWorks. The tables are found in the Downloads &
products view, under the heading Character Data Conversion
Tables. Should you require additional information on any
