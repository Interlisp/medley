#          XCCS charset:     165 JIS

#
#  This file contains mappings from the Xerox Character Code Standard (version
#  XC1-3-3-0, 1987) into Unicode 3.0. standard codes.  That is the version of
#  XCCS corresponding to the fonts in the Medley system.
#
#  The format of this file conforms to the format of the other Unicode-supplied
#  mapping files:
#    Three white-space (tab or spaces) separated columns:
#       Column 1 is the XCCS code (as hex 0xXXXX)
#       Column 2 is the corresponding Unicode (as hex 0xXXXX)
#       Column 3 (after #) is a comment column. For convenience, it contains the
#          Unicode character itself (since the Unicode character names
#          are not available)
#  Unicode FFFF is used for undefined XCCS codes (Column 3 = UNDEFINED
#  Unicode FFFE is used for XCCS codes that have not yet been filled in.
#  (Column 3 = MISSING)
#
#  This file is encoded in UTF8, so that the Unicode characters
#  are properly displayed in Column 3 and can be edited by standard
#  Unicode-enabled editors (e.g. Mac Textedit).
#
#  This file can also be read by the function
#  READ-UNICODE-MAPPING in the UNICODE Medley library package.
#
#  The entries are in XCCS order and grouped by character sets.  In front of
#  the mappings, for convenience, there is a line with the octal XCCS
#  character set, after #.
#
#  Note that a given XCCS code might map to codes in several different Unicode
#  positions, since there are repetitions in the Unicode standard.
#
#  For more details, see the associated README.TXT file.
